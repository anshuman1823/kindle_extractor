The objective of being human is to grow. We see this reflected back to us in every part of life. Species reproduce, DNA evolves to eliminate certain strands and develop new ones, and the edges of the universe are expanding forever outward. Likewise, our ability to feel the depth and beauty of life is capable of expanding forever inward if we are willing to take our problems and see them as catalysts.

If there is an ongoing gap between where you are and where you want to be—and your efforts to close it are consistently met with your own resistance, pain, and discomfort—self-sabotage is almost always at work. On the surface, self-sabotage seems masochistic. It appears to be a product of self-hatred, low confidence, or a lack of willpower. In reality, self-sabotage is simply the presence of an unconscious need that is being fulfilled by the self-sabotaging behavior.

For most people, the abstract fear is really a representation of a legitimate fear. Because it would be too scary to actually dwell on the real fear, we project those feelings onto issues or circumstances that are less likely to occur. If the situation has an extremely low likelihood of becoming reality, it therefore becomes a “safe” thing to worry about, because subconsciously, we already know it isn’t going to happen. Therefore, we have an avenue to express our feelings without actually endangering ourselves.

Your self-concept is an idea that you have spent your whole life building. It was created by piecing together inputs and influences from those around you: what your parents believed, what your peers thought, what became self-evident through personal experience, and so on. Your self-image is difficult to adjust, because your brain’s confirmation bias works to affirm your preexisting beliefs about yourself.

In an effort to “love ourselves,” we try to validate everything about who we are. Yet those warm sentiments never quite seem to stick, only ever temporarily numbing the discomfort. Why don’t they work? Because deep down, we know we are not quite being who we want to be, and until we accept this, we are never going to find peace.

While deep learning models outperform older machine learning approaches to many problems, they are more difficult to develop because they require robust training of data sets and specialized expertise in optimization techniques. Operationalizing and productizing models for enterprise-scale usage also requires different but equally difficult-to-acquire technical expertise. In practice, using simpler AI approaches like older, non-deep-learning machine learning techniques can produce faster and better results than fancy neural nets can.

existing threats will get worse while new threats of an unknown nature will almost certainly emerge. AI will be used to multiply the effects of a malicious campaign—augmenting “human labor, intelligence, and expertise” to make the process of attacking easier and faster—and to broaden the types and number of possible targets. Advances in neural network algorithms that can produce hyperrealistic audiovisual input may be hijacked to produce fake news that looks like it came from a credible source, or to circumvent security systems that use voiceprints or other identifying features. In addition, AI may fundamentally alter the arena of cyber attacks by increasing the efficacy, precision, and untraceability of such attacks.

AI is not a magical solution that instantaneously solves all challenges. Different, often simpler, approaches can also drive many improvements and advancements. Unless your technology initiatives are driven by clear business goals and viability, you run the risk of using AI aimlessly, like a hammer looking for nails. Deploying AI successfully also requires that your organization be “AI-ready," i.e. have a strong culture of data-driven decision-making and technical experimentation. Otherwise, even the most brilliant CAIO in the world won’t do your company any good.

An algorithm is simply a series of logical instructions that show, from start to finish, how to accomplish a task. By this broad definition, a cake recipe counts as an algorithm. So does a list of directions you might give to a lost stranger. IKEA manuals, YouTube troubleshooting videos, even self-help books – in theory, any self-contained list of instructions for achieving a specific, defined objective could be described as an algorithm. But that’s not quite how the term is used. Usually, algorithms refer to something a little more specific. They still boil down to a list of step-by-step instructions, but these algorithms are almost always mathematical objects. They take a sequence of mathematical operations – using equations, arithmetic, algebra, calculus, logic and probability – and translate them into computer code.

Petrov froze in his chair. It was down to him: report the alert, and send the world into almost certain nuclear war; or wait, ignoring protocol, knowing that with every second that passed his country’s leaders had less time to launch a counter-strike. Fortunately for all of us, Petrov chose the latter. He had no way of knowing for sure that the alarm had sounded in error, but after 23 minutes – which must have felt like an eternity at the time – when it was clear that no nuclear missiles had landed on Russian soil, he finally knew that he had been correct. The algorithm had made a mistake. If the system had been acting entirely autonomously, without a human like Petrov to act as the final arbiter, history would undoubtedly have played out rather differently. Russia would almost certainly have launched what it believed to be retaliatory action and triggered a full-blown nuclear war in the process. If there’s anything we can learn from this story, it’s that the human element does seem to be a critical part of the process: that having a person with the power of veto in a position to review the suggestions of an algorithm before a decision is made is the only sensible way to avoid mistakes. After all, only humans will feel the weight of responsibility for their decisions. An algorithm tasked with communicating up to the Kremlin wouldn’t have thought for a second about the potential ramifications of such a decision. But Petrov, on the other hand? ‘I knew perfectly well that nobody would be able to correct my mistake if I had made one.’

Over-ruling the algorithm wasn’t easy: they both had to agree and simultaneously press a button to restart the rollercoaster. Doing so sent the train full of people over the drop to crash straight into the stranded extra carriage. The result was horrendous. Several people suffered devastating injuries and two teenage girls lost their legs. Both of these life-or-death scenarios, Alton Towers and Petrov’s alarm, serve as dramatic illustrations of a much deeper dilemma. In the balance of power between human and algorithm, who – or what – should have the final say?

If your task involves any kind of calculation, put your money on the algorithm every time: in making medical diagnoses or sales forecasts, predicting suicide attempts or career satisfaction, and assessing everything from fitness for military service to projected academic performance.39 The machine won’t be perfect, but giving a human a veto over the algorithm would just add more error.

But there’s a paradox in our relationship with machines. While we have a tendency to over-trust anything we don’t understand, as soon as we know an algorithm can make mistakes, we also have a rather annoying habit of over-reacting and dismissing it completely, reverting instead to our own flawed judgement. It’s known to researchers as algorithm aversion. People are less tolerant of an algorithm’s mistakes than of their own – even if their own mistakes are bigger.

Again, I contact a data broker and give them the information I have on my users. The broker looks for other companies who want to place adverts. And, for the sake of the story, let’s imagine that a company selling sun cream is keen. To persuade them that Fry’s has the audience the sun-cream seller would want to target, the broker could show them some inferred characteristics of Fry’s users: perhaps the percentage of people with red hair, that kind of thing. Or the sun-cream seller could hand over a list of its own users’ email addresses and the broker could work out exactly how much crossover there was between the audiences. If the sun-cream seller agrees, the advert appears on Fry’s website – and the broker and I both get paid.

I want to target men and women over 65 who like tropical islands and have large disposable incomes, in the hope that they’ll want to go on one of our luxurious new Caribbean cruises. Off I go to a data broker who will look through their database and find me a list of people who match my description. So, let’s imagine you are on that list. The broker will never share your name with Fry’s. But they will work out which other websites you regularly use. Chances are, the broker will also have a relationship with one of your favourites. Maybe a social media site, or a news website, something along those lines. As soon as you unsuspectingly log into your favourite website, the broker will get a ping to alert them to the fact that you’re there. Virtually instantaneously, the broker will respond by placing a little tiny flag – known as a cookie – on your computer. This cookiefn1 acts like a signal to all kinds of other websites around the internet, saying that you are someone who should be served up an advert for Fry’s Caribbean cruises. Whether you want them or not, wherever you go on the internet, those adverts will follow you.

How do you decide which problems to tackle first with AI? Our exclusive AI Strategy Framework provides a common set of criteria for evaluating each opportunity. The weighting of each factor will change depending on your business priorities. First, understand the project’s strategic rationale. How does the opportunity fit into your company or department’s overall goals and strategic plan? Decide whether this is a revenue-increasing or a cost-cutting measure. How might this change the products and services that your company offers? Will it open new business opportunities? Typically, opportunities are judged against a mid- to long-term time horizon. Next, consider the opportunity size. Is the opportunity big enough to warrant an AI solution, or can your employees or an older technology adequately solve the problem? Conversely, even if this specific opportunity can be solved more cheaply or easily with human power for now, can an AI-based solution be leveraged for similar tasks in the future? Then, consider the investment level required. How much time and money will you need to allocate towards the problem? Don’t forget to include internal costs. For example, even if an external vendor implements a solution, you will still incur internal management costs. While the next factor, the return on investment (ROI), is never certain, you should estimate an upper and lower bound and a likelihood of success. Understand your break-even number. Don’t forget to include internal costs for project management and opportunity costs in your evaluation. The fifth factor to consider is risk. What is the likelihood that this project will succeed and deliver on the projected ROI? Does this project seem like a sure bet, or is it a moonshot opportunity? Set the performance level that a new technology needs to achieve in order to be deemed successful. Also consider the industry risk of your competitors adopting AI for a core function. Would you lose your competitive advantage if you failed to take action? Timeline is the next factor to consider. Most AI projects require at least a few months of investment before producing positive results for your business. During this period of time, you should constantly be optimizing and testing your technology. A project that will take years to complete should set interim milestones to measure progress. Finally, have other business stakeholders bought in? Most projects will require an interdepartmental effort to gather data, train systems, launch new products, and maintain performance. We’ve developed a more in-depth guide to our AI Strategy Framework that breaks down each of these major efforts into component steps, as well as checklists and recommendations to help you successfully apply our framework to your business.

Once you and your executives are clear on what has happened in your business in the past, the next step is to understand why. During this phase, you move beyond statistical analysis of data into understanding and encoding expert logic for why certain results occurred. For example, your data may show that you had an unusually poor sales quarter last year. When analyzing your sales results along with data from human resources, you may discover that the poor showing is due to your top sales representatives leaving the company around that time. While some knowledge can be encoded, others will require you to augment your quantitative analysis with qualitative interviews and external research. Intelligence: What Will Happen? All businesses want to make key predictions, such as whether a prospect will become a paying customer or if an existing customer is in danger of churning.

AI promises greater operational efficiencies, predominantly in middle and back office functions, such as in legal, finance and accounting, operations, and human resources. However, efficiency alone is not valuable. Focus instead on the increased output or decreased human capital costs that are made possible by efficiency gains. Don’t forget to include potential cost reductions that result from improved compliance and decreased legal risks.

To be worth your investment, the technology may only need to perform at near-human levels. You can buy more computers and run them 24/7 more easily than you can hire, train, and manage staff to perform the same tasks.

The foundation of artificial intelligence is data. Even perfectly-implemented algorithms will fail without the right data. This is no different from a human expert arriving at the wrong conclusions after being given the wrong facts. Many theoretical AI examples assume that you possess enough of the right kind of data, but in the real world, data is often irrelevant, incomplete, or messy.

Agile software development is a time-boxed, iterative approach to building software incrementally. In a traditional waterfall software development model, a product is delivered in its entirety at the end of a project. By contrast, agile processes break down a project into tiny chunks of user functionality that can be addressed in two- to four-week-long cycles called sprints. This strategy uses continuous review to identify potential for improvement after every sprint.

Building a successful machine learning model is just the first step to creating an AI product. In a conference paper titled “The Hidden Technical Debt In Machine Learning Systems,” Google engineers warn that writing the code for a model constitutes only a small fraction of the engineering required for producing a machine learning system.83 The vast majority of the engineering required to productize a model lies in developing and maintaining the vast and complex infrastructure that surrounds the code.

Machine learning debt can be divided into three main types: code debt, data debt, and math debt.86 Code debt arises from the need to revisit and repurpose older code that may no longer suit the project. Data debt focuses on the data that was used to train the algorithm, which may have been incorrect or is no longer relevant.

Handing off the responsibility of filtering resumés, which consists primarily of matching terms or looking for specific experiential phrases, to an AI-based solution can free up to half of the recruiter's day for other tasks. Recruiters can then use the extra time to get better acquainted with existing candidates, thereby improving the overall hiring process.

It is man’s duty to live in conformity with the divine will, and this means, firstly, bringing his life into line with ‘nature’s laws’, and secondly, resigning himself completely and uncomplainingly to whatever fate may send him. Only by living thus, and not setting too high a value on things which can at any moment be taken away from him, can he discover that true, unshakeable peace and contentment to which ambition, luxury and above all avarice are among the greatest obstacles. Living ‘in accordance with nature’ means not only questioning convention and training ourselves to do without all except the necessities (plain food, water, basic clothing and shelter) but developing the inborn gift of reason which marks us off as different from the animal world.

Although Seneca wrote for a relatively narrow circle of educated persons (usually addressing his compositions to a particular friend or relative as if he were that person’s special spiritual adviser) his letters and essays show a Stoicism more closely reconciled with the facts and frailty of human nature. The ideal of apatheia is much modified. Self-sufficient though he is, the sapiens can now have friends and can grieve, within limits, at the loss of one.

The standard which I accept is this: one’s life should be a compromise between the ideal and the popular morality. People should admire our way of life but they should at the same time find it understandable. ‘Does that mean we are to act just like other people?

though it may be cathartic on a temporary basis, striking back often causes great harm to relationships. It hardly ever leads to any consideration of the real problems and to possible compromises. Furthermore, it promotes heated arguments and causes people to lose respect for each other (“I try to reason with him, but all he does is scream. I don’t think he has a brain in his head.”) and to lose respect for themselves (“Why did I tell her that? Now she’ll really think I don’t care about her. How dumb of me!”).

Events don’t determine your emotional reactions—your beliefs about those events do. This has always been true for all your experiences, including those unrelated to your social life. For example, if you were rejected and believed you were doomed to be alone and lonely the rest of your life, you felt sad; if you were rejected and believed you were lucky to be rid of a burdensome friendship, you might well have felt delighted. If you ever got a C in school and believed you deserved a B, you felt disappointed; if you got a C and believed you were lucky to have passed at all, you were happy. If your rent was raised and you believed the increase was unjust, you became upset; if it was raised and you believed it might have been raised still more, you were relieved. The same events caused different reactions, depending upon your beliefs. An ancient Greek philosopher named Epictetus once summed it up when he observed that, “Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the views they take of them.” Shakespeare expressed the view that, “Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”

Catastrophizing self-talk like this causes your stomach to churn, your skin to perspire, your adrenal glands to pump adrenalin into your bloodstream, your heart to pound, and blood to be directed away from your brain and toward your muscles. It triggers in your mind an emergency alert system developed over thousands of years during which our ancestors—cavemen and nomads—needed immediate energy to fiercely fight off or rapidly flee attackers. Although you’re not really in danger, when you catastrophize, your body reacts as though you were, and the high level of anxiety that results is exceedingly uncomfortable. If you do run away, you will be rewarded with an immediate and dramatic drop in your anxiety level. If you stick it out, your tension will probably cause you to respond awkwardly. It’s ironic that when we most want things to go well, we are least able to make them happen. Just when we are most concerned with speaking well, we begin to stumble over our words. When we desperately want to do well on a test, our memory goes blank.

When you find yourself catastrophizing, ask yourself, “How probable is it that these dread consequences I’m imagining will come about?” If you decide that it isn’t likely, tell yourself that in no uncertain terms. You might even make fun of your catastrophizing. If you think it is possible that things won’t work out well, ask yourself, “What’s realistically the worst that’s likely to happen if I fail?” The reality is probably not nearly as frightening as you might have imagined it would be when you thought in general terms.

Finally—and this is important—provide yourself with realistic alternative self-talk. As Dr. Dominic LaRusso of the University of Oregon once said, “As a fluid assumes the shape of its container, ideas and experiences take on the qualities of the words we use to describe them.” A number of recent psychological experiments back up this idea. They show that people who do nothing more than begin using less emotionally charged words in their self-talk can normally significantly reduce their anxiety. Given this information, it makes sense for you to consciously work at replacing “horrible,” “awful,” and “terrible” with words like “unfortunate” and “inconvenient.” For example, if you are about to introduce yourself to a group of strangers, instead of catastrophizing, you might say to yourself, “I’d like to chat with those people. If none of them wants to, it will be unfortunate, but I’ll certainly survive.

Lots of otherwise completely sensible people pin labels on themselves like “quiet,” “neurotic,” “nervous,” and “introverted.” If you accept such labels, you will tend to go round and round in vicious circles like these:

All these labels are based upon poor past performance. When you use them, you make past failure an excuse for present inaction.

After playing the part for a while, you may end up concluding, “I just can’t help acting the way I do,” or “This is just my nature,” and then give up trying.

“The past is a bucket of ashes.” If you’ll only let go of the dead weight of your past shortcomings, you can be free to change and grow and experience a world of exciting possibilities. It really isn’t any more involved than that.

Labels Limit You In addition to being irrational because they assume that your past behavior determines your future behavior and that your past failures make future failures inevitable, labels are irrational because they wrap up your entire being into one word, making situational problems appear global

Just as you may be overgeneralizing about your “nature” or your “fate,” so you may be limiting yourself by overgeneralizing about others. “People are just no damn good. You just can’t trust ’em.” “I’ll never find another friend like Gerry.” “Women aren’t interested in a relationship nowadays. All they want is money.”

Many men and women overgeneralize about others on the basis of an extremely limited sampling. For example, after being rejected by one person, they’ll often conclude that all men or women are no good or that it will be impossible for them to establish a satisfying relationship with anyone ever again. In saying that, they are writing off thousands of potential friends and lovers as a result of unfortunate experiences with one or two.

may have held back in that instance with that person, but that doesn’t mean I’m shy. The fact that I haven’t been more assertive up till now doesn’t mean I can’t be. It just means I’ve got to work on talking more rationally to myself, challenging the nonsense I sometimes tell myself, and doing the things I want to do.

You may be adhering to rigid rules of conduct which are impairing your ability to be socially effective. Men and women follow literally hundreds of “shoulds” and “shouldn’ts,” “oughts” and “oughtn’ts,” “do’s” and “don’ts, “musts” and “mustn’ts,” despite the fact that they only result in failure and frustration.

Before I knew better, I blindly followed a rule which said I shouldn’t ask a woman for her phone number or to go out right after meeting her. “Every guy she meets does that,” I told myself. “So, if I want to seem special, I ought to wait till I see her again.” But Los Angeles in general and UCLA in particular are so huge that months would elapse before I would see a woman a second time. And by that time, I would usually find myself recalled as just a dim memory from the past. If you follow rules like

If you follow rules like these, you are not only limiting your actions, you are sending out false messages to others. Since you can’t not communicate, when you fail to smile or to start a conversation or to issue an invitation or to state your preferences or to talk about yourself or to express love, others will probably conclude on the basis of what they can see that you just don’t care about them.
