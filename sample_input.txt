It’s a big universe. Fourteen billion years after the Big Bang, the region of space we can directly see is populated by a few hundred billion galaxies, averaging a hundred billion stars each. We human beings, by contrast, are quite tiny—a recent arrival on an insignificant planet orbiting a nondescript star.

That can’t last forever; stars use up their fuel, and will eventually fade to black. Astronomers estimate that the last dim star will wink out around 1 quadrillion (1015) years from now. By then other galaxies will have moved far away, and our local group of galaxies will be populated by planets, dead stars, and black holes. One by one, those planets and stars will fall into the black holes, which in turn will join into one supermassive black hole. Ultimately, as Stephen Hawking taught us, even those black holes will evaporate. After about 1 googol (10100) years, all of the black holes in our observable universe will have evaporated into a thin mist of particles, which will grow more and more dilute as space continues to expand. The end result of this, our most likely scenario for the future of our universe, is nothing but cold, empty space, which will last literally forever.

Alloys tend to be stronger than pure metals for one very simple reason: the alloy atoms have a different size and chemistry from the host metal’s atoms, so when they sit inside the host crystal they cause all sorts of mechanical and electrical disturbances that add up to one crucial thing: they make it more difficult for dislocations to move.

physical reasons why there had to be a beginning. One could still imagine that God created the universe at the instant of the big bang, or even afterwards in just such a way as to make it look as though there had been a big bang, but it would be meaningless to suppose that it was created before the big bang.

Okay so here it is. This is how I wrote them down: A boy got shot who is from the same area I live in. Three months before he got shot someone saw me apparently walking past him and saying to him, ‘You’re waste man.’ A couple of months before he was shot a witness saw Jamil, the dead boy, having an argument with a black boy about my age wearing a black hoodie with white Chinese-style writing on the back. Cell-site evidence. The phone expert said that my phone was in the same cell-site as the deceased at the exact moment of the shooting. My phone was also in the same cell-site as his on the day that I was supposed to be arguing with the boy. And it was also in the same cell-site as his phone on the day that I was supposed to be saying, ‘You’re waste man.’ All within one cell-site area. What did that expert say? Fifty or sixty metres? The search of my flat. The police arrested me because they heard a rumour that I was involved in the shooting. They searched my flat and found a Baikal handgun. They found a black hoodie with white Chinese-style writing on the back. They found my phone, which matched the cell-site evidences. They found my passport. They found an e-ticket for a flight to Spain. They found cash, thirty thousand pounds in my rucksack. They found the firearms discharge residue that the prosecution has been going on about, in my car and on the hoodie. They found me. The police say that the bullet which killed the boy, Jamil, must have come from my gun. Ballistics. You remember the guy who came with all his charts and whatever. That bullet came from that gun he says. They found a tiny particle of the dead boy’s blood under my nails. They found a few of my hairs in his car. Open and shut innit? Enough said. You can go home now thank you very much for your attention. And if you did convict me on that you would probably go home and sleep all nice at night. I know that. But you have been sitting here for four weeks doing this case. What I was hoping was that you wanted to make them weeks count for something. But then I thought, I ain’t so sure.

The EU, with a population about 50% larger than the US and with car ownership nearly as high as in the US, consumed only about 13% of the world’s gasoline. The key factors explaining this difference are a higher number of diesel engines, smaller and more efficient gasoline-fuelled vehicles, and average annual distance travelled by car being only about half of the US mean.

Diesels began to replace gasoline-fuelled vehicles in heavy road transport in 1924 when the first direct-injection diesel engine was made and when MAN and Benz and Daimler (two years before their merger) began to make diesel-powered trucks. By the late 1930s most of the new trucks and buses built in Europe were powered by diesel engines and after WWII this dominance was extended to every continent.

They are, much like the engines that power land vehicles, trains and ships, internal combustion engines but they differ from Otto and diesel engines in three fundamental ways. In jet engines the compression of air precedes the addition of fuel in a combustor, the combustion goes on continuously rather than intermittently, and the energy of the hot air flow is extracted by a turbine that is connected to the compressor by a shaft. Gas turbines first compress the air (20–35 times above the atmospheric level) and raise its temperature (to more than 500°C) before forcing it through the combustion chamber where its temperature more than doubles. Part of the energy of the hot gas rotates the turbine and the rest generates forward thrust by exiting through the exhaust nozzle.

The largest of them was the former holding company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, with almost half of the total net value; it eventually became Exxon—and never lost its lead. Next largest, with 9 percent of net value, was Standard Oil of New York, which ultimately became Mobil. There was Standard Oil (California), which eventually became Chevron; Standard Oil of Ohio, which became Sohio and then the American arm of BP; Standard Oil of Indiana, which became Amoco; Continental Oil, which became Conoco; and Atlantic, which became part of ARCO and then eventually of Sun.

If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

Environmentalists and policymakers concerned about climate change frequently complain that current policies are woefully insufficient,13 and nearly all leading analysts—even those who tout the economic, security and environmental benefits of radically reduced oil use—agree that oil won’t soon be driven out of the market. For example, the latest long-term energy outlook from the International Energy Agency, an energy watchdog composed of advanced countries and that strongly favors reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to clean energy, concluded: “For all the current talk about the imminent end to the petroleum age, hydrocarbons will continue to play the leading role in meeting the world’s growing hunger for energy for at least the next quarter of a century, and probably well beyond.”

standardized, and capital or transportation costs are heavy relative to operating costs such that firms cannot respond quickly to changing conditions. Oil met these conditions. But there is one other necessary feature that enables cartels: A natural inclination (ideally by a relatively small number of producers) toward integration and collective action when oversupply develops. Cartels work best when there are a limited number of producers, barriers to entry are high, and patented or elaborate technology is required to produce.

Monopolization of refining and vertical integration with railroads and pipelines sufficed to indirectly limit the flow of oil from the wells and thereby, abolish pre-Standard Oil boom and bust price cycles, even if Rockefeller’s control was insufficient to solely set oil prices or entirely eliminate oil price volatility.96 During the twenty-one years preceding Standard Oil’s dominance, crude oil prices gyrated on average about 53 percent per year (figure 1.1).97 During Rockefeller’s period of control, prices fluctuated by about half as much—24 percent. Of course, consumers paid a higher price for oil than they would have under pure competition—but since oil prices fell on trend during the Rockefeller era, the public did not notice what it was missing.

Rockefeller’s empire centered on refining, transportation and—indirectly—crude oil production in Pennsylvania, the northeastern states, and later the Midwest. But by the turn of the century, crude oil production was fast spreading nationally and globally to areas outside Standard Oil’s reach into Texas and Oklahoma, where Standard Oil was not welcome. The discovery in 1901 of Spindletop, a monster gusher near Beaumont, Texas, by a tenacious prospector named Pattillo Higgins, marked a watershed in the history of the oil industry. Flowing at 100,000 barrels per day, the great Spindletop gusher launched the Texas oil boom as well as two famous companies, Gulf and Texaco. While overdrilling caused Spindletop to dry

In setting quotas, state regulators were trying to resolve two conflicting legal doctrines that had been enshrined into law. One was the rule of capture: “what you can draw out of the ground beneath your feet is yours.” Since oil moves underground toward a wellbore, the law incentivized drillers to drain the pool before others could drill to it. The other legal principle was called correlative rights, which stated “no-one person could act in a manner that inured the property rights of other landowners in an oil field.”29 Correlative rights came into play when laying pipe in a field; if the pipeline owner served just one producer but not others, those not able to access the pipeline would suffer loss of property rights. Thus, the correlative rights doctrine required pipeline companies to service all producers. And if there was not enough pipeline capacity to handle all the drillers, pipelines were obligated to take some oil from each producer, with the amount determined by that producer’s percentage of the total field’s output.30 Requiring each well be allowed—and limited to—a certain amount served the same purpose as quotas.

The combination of anything goes capture and restrictive implication of correlative rights had mixed implications for oil production. In one sense correlative rights supported high production because drillers knew that state authorities would compel pipelines to service at least some of their production, reducing the risk of striking oil but having nowhere to put it.31 But correlative rights also served to limit unbridled production by individual producers in the name of conservation, since regulators could cite the doctrine to defend quotas on grounds production in excess of pipeline takeaway capacity was wasteful production.

Yet many oil industry and oil state officials increasingly believed some form of compulsory supply control would be required to save the industry from itself. One option, called “unitization,” entailed replacing rule of capture with a legal requirement that all the landowners over a large reservoir operate the field as one unit, with one operator deciding how and when to drill in order to maximize efficiency and economic returns. In return for losing the right to drill, the landowner receives a pro rata share of income of the unitized operation.

Why is oil structurally prone to price volatility? The answer, in a nutshell, is that oil demand and supply are insensitive or “sticky” in response to price changes. That is, when oil prices change, supply and demand do not adjust swiftly in response. Therefore, even small imbalances between supply and demand require large price moves to enforce an iron law of economics: that you cannot consume what you do not produce, and that whatever is produced must be either consumed or wasted.1 Some of the specific factors that make oil supply and demand especially sticky have changed over time, but this basic volatility-inducing characteristic of the oil market has endured.

Mandatory quotas introduced supply flexibility where none had previously existed and became the “spigot” that Rockefeller wished he could have had to prevent the industry from shooting itself in the foot through overproducing. Officials could turn crude supply up and down, thereby offsetting the oil supply’s usual “stickiness”—its inability to quickly change in response to new market conditions. Whereas, it could take months to years to find, develop, and produce oil from a new field, new oil supply from spare capacity could flow in days to weeks. Quotas brought order to the chaos of crude oil production.

To understand how crude oil prices were set after the 1920s and through the early 1970s, it is helpful to think of the world as two separate markets—U.S. and non–U.S. In the United States, domestic crude oil prices were set in freely traded markets through arms-length transactions (where the buyer and seller are not affiliated).

Each region in the United States tended to have one large buyer that acted as a price leader, making the first announcement of the price he was prepared to pay for oil from the wells. Smaller refiners would then set their offer prices in relation to the leader’s. There was no cooperation or price fixing and transactions were closely policed by state and federal antitrust authorities. The leader could not impose a price out of line with levels justified by supply and demand. If he set prices too high he would overpay relative to his competitors and if too low he would not obtain the barrels needed during the given period.

For sales the cartel made to nonmembers, Shell, Exxon, and BP selected as its base price the price of crude oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (a West Coast basing point was also established for sales to Asia, but the Gulf handled most exports) and added to this base price the cost of freight from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to the final destination. The rationale for selecting the U.S. Gulf Coast as the base point stemmed from the fact that the U.S. had been and was by far the world’s largest producer and exporter, and was the source of marginal supply. If a refiner anywhere on the planet needed extra crude, the most likely source would be the United States and the price of that crude would be the cost at a Texas port plus transportation charges to the refiner.

Suspicions of the Seven Sisters united the two nations and convinced U.S. and United Kingdom officials to negotiate terms for bilateral oil market cartel composed of both governments. Negotiations between the wartime allies started in April 1944 and aimed at what the State Department called the “orderly distribution of abundance” of Middle Eastern oil.109 On August 8 both sides signed the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement that set up an eight-member International Petroleum Commission. The Commission would, among other things, estimate global demand and suggest production quotas to various countries. The agreement included assurances that both governments would implement commission recommendations. The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement met quick and stiff opposition from the oil industry, again wary of federal usurpation of control over quotas and price fixing that seemed to be lifted straight out of the playbook the TRC and Seven Sisters’ As-Is agreement. The oil industry sharply opposed Washington’s attempt to enter the oil market management business. In the end the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement was withdrawn so it could be watered down to suit the industry’s concerns, but was ultimately abandoned.

The majors and their Texas-plus price system were not the only subjects of criticism from the United States and Europe; soon, they came under fire from the concession governments themselves. Since concession agreements typically included a royalty on every barrel produced, host governments cared more about maximizing the barrels produced than the price per barrel. But in 1948, a nationalist government in Venezuela won a “50-50” share of profits from oil production, and Saudi Arabia and other Middle East producers soon demanded the same “50-50” treatment.113 To fulfill this demand would amount to a sea change in how oil was priced worldwide. Under the old Texas-plus system, crude oil was rarely quoted or priced in a producing country; instead, majors quoted prices in delivery ports. But to effectuate the new 50-50 profit-sharing system, producers needed to establish a price in the host producing country as a basis on which to calculate income and profits. Thus, in 1949 the Texas-plus price system was replaced by oil prices quoted at ports of loading in Venezuela and the Persian Gulf. The Seven Sisters were obliged to establish the same “base point” for all their customers that they had initially set just for sales between themselves.

Through the early 1950s, the administered prices set in concession countries mirrored Texas prices. But the inundation of new Middle Eastern oil combined with the entry of new producers unaffiliated with majors—called “independents”—made it increasingly difficult for the majors to maintain price parity between the Middle East and the United States.

In October 1956, mounting tensions between nationalist Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser and Britain, France, and Israel boiled over into military conflict. Disruption in traffic through the Suez Canal and of oil piped to the eastern Mediterranean from Middle Eastern fields pushed oil prices up, and shortages threatened Western Europe (which depended on Middle Eastern supplies).

The higher prices caused by the Suez crisis were made to stick through lower quotas imposed by Texas and oil states133—but having to cut production to accommodate “foreign oil” of course made independent oil producers and their elected officials in producing states and Washington very unhappy, even if it did raise spare capacity that could be used in times of crisis.

Not just TRC but also the domestic oil industry and its congressional supporters clamored for protection from the tsunami of oil imports from the Middle East. While tariffs on imports had been imposed in the early 1930s, they had been reduced in 1939 and 1943 when the need for oil was high, and again after World War II in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947.134 But even as the United States shifted from being a crude exporter to importer, the flood of new cheap oil from the Middle East would revive the debate about import controls.

As imports flooded the market, U.S. independent oil producers joined the chorus of complaints to the federal government, invoking the national security argument that cheap imports were killing a vital domestic energy sector.

Actual imports continued to climb beyond 1954 levels, raising ire among domestic producers and pushing Washington toward mandatory controls. In 1957, a Cabinet-level Special Committee concluded that while cheap oil imports were “attractive,” “excessive” reliance on them would jeopardize national security.138 By 1959, President Eisenhower instituted compulsory oil quotas roughly equal to 9 percent of domestic consumption. Canada and Mexican imports were exempted. Byzantine in design and extraordinarily complex to implement, the Mandatory Oil Import Program (MOIP) lasted 14 years.

In September 1959, Exxon led a round of administered price cuts of about 5 percent, angering Venezuela and the Middle East countries. In August 1960 the majors cut administered prices another 10 percent, triggering a storm of indignation—and, unknown to them at the time, precipitating the creation of a group that would eventually inherit the role of stabilizing the global oil market.143 Infuriated at the sudden loss of revenue, the host governments banded together to form a new organization uniting petroleum producing countries to resist the majors’ price cuts. It was called the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, better known by its acronym OPEC.

While irrepressible supply and demand pressures, driven in the United States in large part by quotas and import quotas, forced U.S. prices up and Middle Eastern ones down, host governments resisted any reduction in administered prices because, under the new system where royalties were paid on profits rather than barrels produced, that would lower their payments. Yet to sell their oil in an increasingly crowded and competitive market, majors found themselves compelled to offer discounts off of administered prices in the Persian Gulf, while still paying the royalties on unchanged administered prices. The Seven Sisters profits were getting squeezed. By the late 1950s the frustrated majors concluded it was only reasonable that host countries should share the burden of lower real-world crude oil prices. Channeling the producer’s viewpoint, Parra wrote, “Now was the time to in effect reaffirm the principle that profit sharing meant profit sharing, on the downside as on the upside.”

The late 1950s marked the apogee of the TRC and the Seven Sisters control over international oil supply and prices. The majors’ control weakened and then collapsed in the 1970s as host governments took over control of pricing and nationalized concessions. And in the United States, the Texas Era of price control was ending by the late 1960s as soaring domestic demand outpaced supply. With an import tariff, the United States had disconnected itself from the global oil market to some extent. Outside the United States oil prices fell during the decade, despite healthy demand, because of the surge in cheap oil supplies that were effectively barred from the U.S. market. In the United States, the TRC was able to keep crude prices stable for most of the 1960s, but to do so had to increase quotas, resulting in less U.S. spare capacity (see figure 4.7).

Obliged to continue ordering higher production to keep up with rising demand and thereby watch spare capacity shrink, the end of the road for the TRC’s oil market management came on March 16, 1972, at their first-ever meeting in El Paso. Presiding over rooftop ballroom packed with oil executives, a disappointed and worried Chairman Byron Tunnell ordered full production for the first time since 1947, calling the decision “a damn historic occasion and a sad occasion”—“sad” because there was plenty of oil to be found, Tunnell said, but Congress had impeded the search with tax increases and new environmental policies. As it was, Texas’s 8,500 oil fields could no longer serve as “reliable old warriors,” surging to meet emergency demand from other states and allies as they once did.

The post–World War II boom in oil consumption came from both new and old uses. With the new cheap supplies available after World War II oil started to displace coal for heating and electricity generation. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, “mass motorization” drove demand. From 1950 to 1973 the worldwide number of automobiles and other passenger vehicles exploded from 53 million to nearly 250 million.147 Europe and Japan saw massive increase in oil use, for motorized transport. Rapidly expanding civil aviation and the birth of the plastics industry also boosted oil use. It was the dawn of the era, as preeminent oil market scholar Daniel Yergin called it, of the “Hydrocarbon Man.”

Hoping to replicate Mexico’s nationalization of its oil industry thirteen years earlier, in April 1951 the newly elected and fiercely nationalist Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh signed a law nationalizing the country’s oil assets. The ejection of BP—Iran’s sole southern concessionaire, then called the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company—prompted threats and reprisals from London. BP and her six other Sisters promptly boycotted Iranian oil exports, forcing the country’s production to fall to near zero. The sudden loss of Iran’s oil spurred U.S. officials to activate some of the procedures and policies used during World War II to encourage maximum oil output and efficient transportation, and the majors increased production from their concessions in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. Although world production rose by three times more than the amount of Iran’s lost supplies by 1952,1 the United States and the United Kingdom were concerned enough about permanently losing Iran’s oil and about possible communist encroachment that in early 1953 they began preparing and executing steps to undermine Mossadegh and replace him with a friendlier premier. Mossadegh was overthrown in a coup in August 1953, the Shah was reinstated, and the door to the West reopened (wider than before, as Washington insisted that BP share its Iranian concession with other companies, including U.S. independent producers).

Strategic stock releases following a severe supply interruption were “expected to help calm markets, mitigate sharp price spikes, and reduce the economic damage that had accompanied the 1973 disruption.” Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases would also “buy time” for a geopolitical crisis “to sort itself out” or for diplomacy to resolve before the oil disruption itself caused it to metastasize beyond ability of diplomacy to resolve.56

While the short-lived Arab Oil Embargo enjoyed most of the notoriety, a more important and enduring change took place at the same time; OPEC assumed control of administering prices. The process of administering prices in producing countries had swung from unilateral imposition by majors after World War II, to an informal freeze in the early 1960s, to unilateral imposition by producer countries in the 1970s.

At first OPEC shunned the spot market and attempted to implement their own version of the defunct majors’ administered price system. They agreed to designate Saudi Arabia’s Arabian Light crude blend as a reference or marker crude; other producers would price their blends in relation to it, adjusting for quality and freight differences.

starting in the early 1970s OPEC countries demanded and received partial and eventually full ownership of the oil. As OPEC members came to own more of their crude, they had to figure out how and where to sell it. At first OPEC countries just forced majors to buy back their equity crude at inflated prices. But rising prices in small spot markets started to look more attractive to OPEC governments which began to sidestep their concession companies and sell their equity crude in spot transactions directly with third-party brokers or other intermediaries.

When supply surpluses appeared in mid-1974 and oil prices weakened toward the end of the year, OPEC staff recommended production cutbacks. OPEC rejected formal quotas, although the question of sharing losses began to dominate their discussions. Saudi Arabia informally agreed to act as the shock absorber, cutting production from 8.8 mb/d in October 1974 to 5.7 mb/d in March 1975.61 This was the first instance of Saudi Arabia acting as a swing producer. The period from 1974 through 1978 was relatively calm. OPEC kept administered benchmark prices generally stable, implementing only two increases. In inflation adjusted terms, crude oil prices actually fell about 10 percent in value from immediately after the Arab oil embargo of 1973.62 It appeared the world had reached a new, higher, but stable, normal level for oil prices. But that normality was about to be dashed by a revolution in Iran.

While Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers were able to partially offset Iran’s loss and global oil production actually increased in 1978, the swiftness of Iran’s decline startled the market.63 Actual world production rose in 1979, but the loss of Iran’s 2 mb/d (about 3 percent of the prior year’s supply) triggered a 126 percent price increase for oil64—even though inventories and spare capacity were still ample. One explanation of the outsized price spike was a desire by importers to build even higher inventories as a precaution.

As the Iran revolution and the oil disruption and price shock brought the United States and Saudi Arabia closer together, it also intensified ancient Saudi-Iranian ethnic, religious, and geopolitical rivalries, making them a permanent feature of geopolitics—and as we shall see, OPEC oil policy—in the decades since. Saudi Arabia is the center of Islam’s Sunni sect and home to its two most revered sites, Mecca and Medina. The majority of Iran’s citizens adhere to the Shiite sect of Islam; while Shiites also dominate Iraq and Bahrain, they comprise only 15 percent of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims.81 Tehran and Riyadh compete for leadership within Islam, although before the nineteenth century, their rivalry had been suppressed by distance, lack of direct economic and political linkages, and intervention by foreign powers. In the 1950s, when both became major oil powerhouses, their vital interests became closely intertwined. Until 1979 both monarchies kept tensions low. But the 1979 Iranian revolution established a revolutionary Islamic state scathingly critical of both Sunni sect and especially the Saudi monarchy and unleashed a succession of mostly indirect conflict and proxy wars.82

After the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in late December, 1979, President Carter—reflecting increased worries inform U.S. defense planners about a threat to the Gulf’s energy resources—stated the United States would not allow the Persian Gulf to be dominated by a hostile outside power, and established a new military command (the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, forerunner to CENTCOM) to back it up. It quickly was dubbed the “Carter Doctrine.”

The traumatic price spikes in 1973 and 1979–1980 are often twinned, but are very different. In 1973, OPEC deliberately imposed price increases while taking control of pricing from majors. The process was hardly elegant, but it was deliberate. There was no significant disruption of crude oil, and shortages in consuming countries were largely due to domestic price controls and rationing. In the case of the 1979 Iranian revolution and the 1980 Iran-Iraq war, there was a major supply disruption, especially the latter, although commercial inventories were quite ample. The disruption and panic sent market prices up, and OPEC simply followed along by raising prices. By 1981 OPEC’s administered prices reached $34 per barrel, roughly three times their level three years before.

OPEC hoped (and consuming countries feared) that the group could enjoy a sustained large market share and high prices.1 But those widespread expectations and fears were about to be dashed by another mammoth changeover in global oil supply and demand trends. Suddenly and unexpectedly, OPEC was hit by a triple whammy—collapsing demand, soaring competition from new producers, and weakening in the role of administered prices versus market—determined ones. It was OPEC’s turn to be shaken to its core by an unexpected upheaval in the global oil market.

Production from these fields, located close to European markets, competed directly with OPEC exporters. Plummeting demand and soaring non-OPEC supply cut savagely into the cartel’s market share, which fell from over 50 percent in the early 1970s to less than 30 percent by 1985

OPEC was fast losing control over setting the price of oil. Since the 1950s, administered prices had served as benchmarks for calculating tax and royalty payments to host governments under the concessions. OPEC continued to set administered prices after wresting control from the Seven Sisters in the early 1970s. But by the end of that decade concessions were more or less extinct as producers had nationalized them. Now shorn of links to old concessions, crude refiners and traders bought crude on spot markets, where prices were not determined by OPEC but instead determined by arms-length trading between parties with no other link other than a desire to exchange crude oil for cash. Administered prices were fast becoming a relic.

The combination in the early 1980s of weakening demand and expansion of market-based spot crude trading prompted a transformation in how both producers and consumers viewed oil. Whereas in the 1970s oil was considered a special commodity whose price would inexorably rise as voracious consumption devoured limited remaining resources, in the 1980s people started to consider oil just another commodity, no longer impervious to market forces, but instead subject to them, albeit with a multiyear lag. Soaring prices had eventually—with a multiyear lag—helped break consumption growth and triggered massive new supplies, turning perceived dearth into a glut.

Oil cartels, as the earliest attempts in the western Pennsylvania Oil Regions proved over 100 years earlier, are susceptible to disintegration because individual members have a strong incentive to cheat, especially if they believe other members will adhere to limits. So it was with OPEC, which never achieved the durable discipline and cohesiveness the Seven Sisters did—hardly surprising, as OPEC never controlled as much traded oil and was composed of economically and politically rivalrous members. The OPEC member cohesion soon fell apart as most producers ignored quotas and produced as much as they could. Iran, then at war with fellow member Iraq, did not even pretend to abide by quotas, and most of the other members continued to sell oil on the spot market.

In late October 1985, Saudi Arabia opened the taps and flooded the market. It did so by formulating a new pricing policy designed to push out as much oil as customers could handle. Instead of selling oil to refiners based on an administered price, the kingdom would sell on a “netback” basis. Under netbacks, Saudi Arabia guaranteed its refinery customers a fixed refining margin.16 This was a dream come true for refiners. Under the previous system, the refiners’ margin was uncertain. Refiners paid up front (ex-ante) for the crude, but they bore the risk of losing money if refined product prices fell in the two months or so that it took to transport that barrel to a refinery, process it into gasoline and fuel oil, and sell it (ex-post).

To avoid losing sales to Saudi Arabia, other OPEC producers had to implement a netback price and soon a full-blown (if undeclared) price war was on—among OPEC and non-OPEC producers alike. Refiners gorged on Saudi and OPEC crude, creating a glut of refined products that lowered product prices, which in turn fed back to weaker crude oil prices.

at a meeting in Geneva in December 1986, new Saudi Minister Hisham Nazer and his OPEC colleagues agreed to an $18 per barrel price target (the $18 pricing being a “reference price”35 based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC, Mexican, administered crude prices) and accepted a new, more flexible quota system that would be revised every three months.36 (This pricing system, albeit somewhat modified, endures today.) The price plunge, and the recognition of the control that OPEC (and especially Saudi Arabia) had over oil prices, led to a shift in the United States’ attitude toward a group that it had routinely denounced since its founding. For example, in May 1987 U.S. Secretary of Energy John Herrington—who had once called OPEC’s control over the market “unacceptable”—indicated that the United States was supporting Saudi efforts to achieve stability for oil prices.

Oil trading was increasingly done in arms-length transactions and in spot markets and the forward market, where oil was bought for the future instead of for immediate delivery. Mexico was the first producer to adopt market-based pricing, in 1986. Within a couple of years all other producers followed, dropping administered prices for market-based ones.38 Moreover, the expansion of spot market transactions and associated, rapid penetration of market-based futures contracts for crude and refined products rendered a return to administered prices impractical.39 By 1988 Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers conceded that henceforth prices would be set in free markets, with their crude oil sales priced against market-determined benchmarks depending on the destination of their exports.40 The implication of market-based pricing was that producers would no longer set—and haggle over—administered prices. Instead, OPEC would leave the prices to the market and instead use supply agreements or quotas as the main policy tool to reach or maintain a target price. In a sense, this shifted the nature of OPEC’s control away from the Seven Sisters and more toward the TRC, which directly controlled supply to achieve a price target but did not administer prices per se.

Generally, only Saudi Arabia withheld producible oil from the market. But OPEC got lucky as supply outside the organization—in Mexico, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom—slipped in the late 1980s.44 But for these fortuitous supply cuts, low oil prices due to weak OPEC discipline may well have continued through the decade and the organization could have disintegrated. Instead, the misfortune of other producers enabled OPEC to increase its market share from 29 percent in 1985 to 37 percent in 1990.45 Arab Light prices ranged between $13 and $19 per barrel from the first quarter of 1986 through the second quarter of 1990.

Saddam invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, opening the world’s first oil war.50 Kuwaiti oil disappeared and Iraqi oil was promptly embargoed. Prices initially doubled from $17 to $36 in September as both producers abruptly disappeared from the market. Once again, it became clear how useful spare capacity was during a large geopolitical disruption. Saudi Arabia ramped up production; its output rose from 5.4 mb/d in July to nearly 8 mb/d in September and held that level for more than a year. Despite the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, total OPEC supply was back to pre-invasion levels by November 1990.That extra supply from OPEC, plus inventories, more than covered the supply shortfall from Iraq and Kuwait.

Under it, a target range for the OPEC basket price was set at $22 to $28, and members agreed to a quota adjustment factor whereby quotas would rise by a total of 500 kb/d if prices exceeded $28 for 20 consecutive days, and would be reduced by the same amount of if prices fell below $22 for ten consecutive days. OPEC did not intend for this adjustment factor to work wholly on an “automatic” basis, however. It was meant as a general framework for members while signaling in advance OPEC’s intention in the event prices moved outside the range.

While oil prices were steadiest in the (early) 1980s (when Saudi Arabia was still willing to play the swing producer role), OPEC market management in the 1990s and early 2000s was fairly impressive (see figure 8.1). With a few brief exceptions, crude prices oscillated in a $15–$22 range for most of the nineties, and OPEC reacted with unusual discipline to the price crash after its unfortunate decision to increase production in 1997. OPEC was able to recapture market share, which rose from 37 percent in 1990 to over 40 percent by the end of the decade (see figure 8.2).

Writing in 2003, former OPEC Secretary General Francisco Parra expressed confidence that OPEC producers could achieve a stable price range of $22–$28, but with one qualification. Success, Parra cautioned, depended “in large measure on a dangerous reliance on essentially one country—Saudi Arabia, and its continued good will—as sole guardian of the world’s spare producing capacity.”

But this trend unexpectedly reversed in 2005 as President Putin became less friendly to the independent oil companies, foreign capital and technology that had generated the supply boom and that was needed to opening up new, difficult fields.6 But Putin cared less about how much oil was produced and more about who benefited financially and politically from the production.

As usual, most of that capacity was in Saudi Arabia, which had already increased production due to the Iraq invasion, Venezuela labor strikes, and disruption in Nigeria.

In the 1970s, oil prices spiked partly due to the perception of tighter oil markets if not looming exhaustion of supplies. This was especially true earlier in the decade, when actual disruptions were small. Even when the Iran Revolution and Iran-Iraq war disrupted supply, it is questionable whether physical oil tightness adequately explained the price spikes, given substantial unused OPEC production capacity and ample if not brimming, inventories.19 But after 2005, it was much clearer that the oil market was structurally tightening. The implication was faster price increases, more volatile price generally, and spikes when disruptions or disruption risks occurred.

In 2005 a report by three researches sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (though not reflecting government views) titled “Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, & Risk Management” concluded: The peaking of world oil production presents the U.S. and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem. As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the economic, social, and political costs will be unprecedented. Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking.31

One of the challenges involved in trying to predict when oil production will peak and start to decline is measuring the amount of “proved reserves” (oil that can be drilled profitably given prevailing prices and technology) in the earth’s crust. Estimates of proved reserves depend on current and future price and prices and technological innovation, both of which are constantly changing and unpredictable.

Speculator is a loaded term, and often misunderstood—in the case of oil, it refers simply to a person who buys or sells oil for some purpose other than immediate use (usually, in anticipation of a future price change).38 Speculators have been around as long as markets have existed and often been blamed for causing shortages and price spikes for critical commodities, especially food.

Oil exchanges flourished in the industry’s early decades but largely died out during most of the twentieth century as the TRC and Seven Sisters managed supply and stabilized process. Exchanges made a return in the 1980s. In today’s oil industry, speculation is accomplished by buying and selling oil futures and derivatives contracts on organized exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange in London. Exchanges and trading exist because oil market participants want to hedge or insure against adverse oil price moves. A fuel purchaser for an airline company goes to an exchange to lock in forward prices for jet fuel. A refinery wants to lock in prices for gasoline it will sell in four months. A shale oil producer may seek protection on the price of output from the company’s wells in the next year—and its lending bank may insist on it. The oil industry also values exchanges because they provide transparent, publicly available, and unbiased price information.

Speculators are necessary for well-functioning exchanges because they provide “liquidity”—a deep pool of ready buyers or sellers. Excluding speculators would have drastically limited the number of sellers and buyers and, therefore, the number of transactions, reducing the value of the exchanges and providing a transparent price signal to everyone. Speculators are needed to take the price risk that hedgers want to shed. Speculators are happy to take a bet on where prices are going, whereas many oil market participants prefer to focus on what they do best: fly planes, produce gasoline, drill for oil.

Today, the line between speculating and hedging gets blurred. For example, some oil producers may decide to “hedge” or lock in prices by buying futures contracts when they believe prices are going to fall. But a producer who decides not to lock in prices when they are expected to rise is in effect speculating on rising prices.

Those who disagree with the view that speculators, whether traditional buy-or-sell or passive buy-only, distort oil prices make several counterpoints. First, they assert, oil market participants are not better informed than anyone else about the “true” supply and demand—partly because of enormous gaps in data. As the wildly inaccurate forecasts by OPEC and oil companies from the late 1960s through early 1980s show, oil companies have hardly demonstrated superior clairvoyance about future oil prices.

To the degree that speculators are informed and their buying or selling brings new information to the market, their actions can enhance social welfare by making oil available when it is needed. They can also signal a tightening market, and the resulting price increase stimulates more production and less consumption, thus making more oil available in the future.47 Second, to “distort” or “manipulate” prices, speculators would have to hoard physical supply and take advantage of weak or broken convergence between paper and physical markets. That is because under exchange trading rules, anyone who holds a “long” futures contract when it expires in a given month must take physical delivery, and whoever is “short” must deliver the oil. Futures and physical prices converge primarily because any discrepancy creates a profitable arbitrage opportunity. Traders would jump on the price discrepancy, finding a way to take delivery in the futures market and then offset the position in the spot market until the discrepancy was no longer profitable. This mandatory convergence between paper and physical barrels at monthly settlements keeps oil futures linked to physical reality in the oil market.48 There is no evidence that this convergence, which is closely watched by market participants, is broken.

Furthermore, the size of the futures market when combined with its strict regulatory environment, makes it near impossible for one or more individuals to corner the oil market by accumulating and removing enough oil supply to manipulate prices. In fact, oil inventories had fallen significantly below normal in 2007 and 2008, suggesting that as high and fast as oil price had risen, they were still not rising enough to bring demand down to available supply.49 Third, critics of Masters’ thesis that long-only investors were behind the increase in prices point out that the price of commodities not actively traded on futures exchanges (thus, out of reach of speculators, including massive passives) were rising as much or even more (in the case of rice and iron ore) than those traded on exchanges like oil.50 This suggests the cause of co-movement among commodities, including oil, was economic, not rooted in financial flows.51 In October 2008 the IMF noted the broad commodity boom was similar in magnitude to the commodity price boom of the early 1970s,52 when there were no major futures trading in oil, much less “massive passives.”

Energy economist James Hamilton concluded that although the oil price run-up from 2004 to 2008 was influenced by the inflow of investment dollars into commodity futures contracts, oil’s low price elasticity of demand and the failure of production to increase sufficiently prior to the peak explained the phenomenon. Supply and demand, instead of speculation per se, was the cause of oil’s dramatic price moves.

However, there are many problems with the notion of using strategic stocks to stabilize oil prices, even if policymakers were willing to buy and sell depending on tightness or surplus in the market.62 The main problem is that buy and sell decisions would doubtless be influenced by political or budgetary considerations, not just for market stabilization.

However, there are many problems with the notion of using strategic stocks to stabilize oil prices, even if policymakers were willing to buy and sell depending on tightness or surplus in the market.62 The main problem is that buy and sell decisions would doubtless be influenced by political or budgetary considerations, not just for market stabilization. Moreover, to be effective, strategic stock releases would need to be coordinated among IEA members. Some IEA members could find themselves squabbling about burden sharing just like OPEC members do, as some would argue it makes no sense for one country to release stocks while others hold on to or increase theirs.63 Another problem with using strategic stocks to stabilize prices is operational. The SPR was designed for large-scale, infrequent withdrawals in anticipation of major supply emergencies, not frequent withdrawals and fills. Frequent, small uses of the SPR caused the underground salt caverns holding crude to deteriorate, because to release oil freshwater is injected into the salt caverns. Injecting freshwater in small volumes at low rates results in uneven salt leaching that misshapes the caverns, reducing their integrity. (One solution would be to invest in infrastructure to inject fully saturated brine instead of freshwater, although this would require expensive capital expenditures.

Moreover, even assuming political interference could be excluded, officials could try to defend price levels or ranges that are inconsistent with actual market fundamentals. If they tried to hold prices below levels justified by fundamentals, they would expend all of the reserves, giving them away at cheap prices to market participants.

Since the 1970s, Saudi Arabia’s possession of substantial spare capacity had given it enormous clout within OPEC, conferring on Riyadh the power to wield and if necessary enforce the threat of flooding the market over other producers. Saudi Arabia had used its leverage with devastating effect in late 1985 and 1986, and the threat of a repeat helped producers muster the will to contribute cuts in the late 1990s and early 2002. But with the oil market firm and Saudi spare capacity low, its clout ebbed, and its traditional rivals within OPEC—and geopolitically, in the case of Iran—were emboldened to challenge the Saudis in setting OPEC policy.

The objective of SPR is to release a lot of oil quickly in response to an emergency supply interruption, thereby dampening any economically harmful price impact. The maximum speed and rate of SPR releases is untried and therefore unknown. The Department of Energy, which manages the SPR, publicly states the initial drawdown rate is 4.4 mb/d for delivery within 13 days of a Presidential decision,23 though in 2015 noted the SPR requires “significant maintenance and upgrades to enhance its distribution capability.”

Since the TRC and Seven Sisters lost control in the early 1970s, it seemed that every five years or so something dramatic and unexpected came along to transform the oil market. Between 2010 and 2015, small and independent U.S. oil producers—whose forebearers ignited the modern oil market and subsequently discovered giant gushers like Spindletop and the Black Giant—once again sprang a surprise on the world oil market: U.S. shale.

If the shale boom has a father, it is veteran oilman George Mitchell, —one of Houston’s largest oil and gas producers. In the 1980s, geologists employed by Mitchell noticed that when sinking deep wells through shale rock, geological instruments registered large amounts of natural gas.

A rudimentary form of fracking was used after the Civil War by drillers who dropped explosive “torpedoes” into wells to shatter rock and accelerate oil flow, and the technology was further developed with the support of the federal government amid fears of shortages during the oil and gas boom in the early 1970s. By then, a common oilman saying was “when everything else fails, frack it.”

Mitchell’s innovation was to try to frack in much deeper wells extending into shale rock. In 1982 he sunk his first well into the Barnett shale, a vast geological formation that runs under, and mostly westward from Dallas. While successful, the endeavor was expensive. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Mitchell and his colleagues doggedly tinkered and experimented with various fracking methods, and in 1997 eventually came up with the method of blasting water mixed with small amounts of proppants (sand or other solid particulate material strong enough to prop open fractures and liberate oil and gas) down into the wellbore where it would shoot out laterally into the rock, creating fissures through which the liberated gas molecules would flow.37 So-called “slick water fracks” were much cheaper than prevailing methods. As technology improved, several factors came together after 2000 to enable oil drillers to produce large amounts of shale gas profitably, including “government policy private entrepreneurship, private land and mineral rights ownership, high natural gas prices, market structure, favorable geology, water availability, and natural gas pipeline infrastructure.”38 Commercial shale gas production began in the Barnett shale in north-central Texas in 2000. More companies started drilling wells in the Barnett shale and soon it was producing “almost half-a-trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year.” Soon development moved on to other shale formations, including “the Haynesville in eastern Texas and north Louisiana, the Woodford in Oklahoma, the Eagle Ford in southern Texas, and the Marcellus and Utica shales in northern Appalachia.”

Shale gas drillers were so successful; they helped crush the price of natural gas, which fell from a $6 per mmBtu to $14 mmBtu range between 2005 and 2008 down to a $1.70 to $6.00 range since.40 As the shale gas boom triggered a natural gas price bust, drillers shifted fracking from natural gas to oil wells. As a result, U.S. shale oil (also called “light tight oil,” LTO) soared from less than 0.5 mb/d to over 4.5 mb/d in 2015.

While Saudi oil policymaking is famously enigmatic, kingdom’s leaders seem to have concluded that the oil market had become too big to manage successfully on its own, and that OPEC as a cartel had not been and never would be cohesive enough to do the job. Given this, it seems to have decided that the optimal strategy is to hunker down and prepare to live with more volatile prices instead of vainly trying to prevent them. In February 2016, Saudi Oil Minister Naimi addressed a major energy conference in Houston and explained to the oil industry why OPEC did not cut on November 27, 2014: “[T]here was no appetite for sharing the burden. So we left it to the market as the most efficient way to rebalance supply and demand. It was—it is—a simple case of letting the market work.”105

If we learned in 2008 that Saudi Arabia was no longer able to defend a price ceiling, since 2014 we’ve learned it is unwilling to put a floor under oil prices. Riyadh’s refusal to swing along should not have been surprising; Saudi policy was set against it after 1986 and constantly restated. But it also was not tested until after 2009, when three years of $100 oil prices unleashed investment in new production—including fast rising shale. For the first time since the early 1980s, Saudi Arabia was being asked to step into the role of a genuine swing producer. It declined.

Saudi Arabia’s loss of spare production capacity resembles 1972, when the TRC ran out of spare capacity and therefore, lost control of the oil market for good. Whereas after 2004, Saudi Arabia embarked on new investments to raise spare production capacity, in 2008 it did not. Saudi Arabia does retain a small amount of spare capacity—about 1.5 mb/d according to the latest EIA data, though estimates by private sector analysts tend to be lower.

OPEC needed to make room not only for shale and oil sands, but also for new production capacity within its ranks. Therefore by forecasting total OPEC production would fall, IEA effectively assumed one or more OPEC members would have to be willing to cut their own supply by around 1.5 mb/d, while others like Iraq and UAE increased, to avoid excessive overall production, which would lead to inventory builds and a price collapse.

While cautioning OPEC cohesion was a risk, BP said it assumed OPEC members would cut production, but did not specify which ones.

OPEC’s decision on whether to make room for new supply inside and outside OPEC carried enormous repercussions for oil prices. If one or more OPEC producers agreed to cut production, they could fend off a price collapse and the IEA’s $111—95 assumptions would hold. But if OPEC countries refused to cut production and decided to fully produce from new fields, prices would precipitously drop. None of these forecasts envisaged oversupply and a price collapse; all assumed stable prices through the end of the decade. Thus IEA, OPEC, and BP—and most market participants and industry—assumed OPEC would cut to keep prices stable.

Consensus assumptions that OPEC (read Saudi Arabia) would cut production to make room for shale and other competitors yielded two comforting conclusions. Oil prices would remain stable around $90–$100 and spare capacity would rise 50 percent–100 percent to a more comfortable 4 mb/d–6 mb/d range—a vital shock absorber that was desperately needed given ongoing tumult and geopolitical disruptions or disruption risk in the Persian Gulf, North and West Africa, and Latin America. But the assumption that Saudi Arabia would play the swing producer role was deeply flawed. Cutting production in a healthy market, handing over market share to Iraq (and likely Iran, when its oil was back on the market), and supporting high oil prices so shale and oil sands projects could flourish was not in the cards for Riyadh. Whereas consensus forecasts might have assumed that a declining call on OPEC crude would be offset by Saudi Arabia cutting production, what these forecasts were really but recognizedly signaling was a supply glut and price collapse.

Financial, commercial, and geopolitical circumstances reinforced the kingdom’s refusal to cut production unilaterally in 2014. The kingdom had accumulated over $700 billion in foreign exchange reserves and had extremely low domestic debt, putting it in a much stronger financial position to withstand a bout of low oil prices than other oil exporters with bigger debt burdens and smaller foreign exchange war chests.

Geopolitical tensions also influenced oil policy. Relations between Tehran and Riyadh were much worse in 2014 than they had been under relatively moderate Iranian president Khatami in the late 1990s when both last cooperated in cutting supply. Russia was inserting itself in the region more aggressively and on the side of Iran and of another archenemy, Syrian dictator Assad. And while relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq had improved since Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003, Riyadh and other Gulf Sunni powers considered now Shia-dominated Iraq to be sympathetic to Iran.

Shale was still working at falling oil prices. Many shale companies had hedged some of their future production in derivatives markets, thus locking in higher prices.91 Furthermore, the costs of producing shale (including hiring service companies to frack wells, disposing of the briny “flowback water,” and transportation) fell rapidly with prices. This was bad news for the profits of service companies (and bad news for workers too, with over 93,000 jobs lost in the sector between January and November 2015),92 but good news for drillers who were realizing savings. And finally, shale oil producers were employing new methods and technologies to improve their efficiency and further lower the cost of producing. For example, producers were able to drill more wells from a single well site and improved productivity by adding thousands of pounds of sand to frack fluids. Shale producers—like the traditional drillers before them—had other reasons besides profits to keep operations going despite falling costs. Many shale oil companies were required to continue drilling to keep their lease. If they stopped drilling, they could lose the lease and opportunity to produce in the future. And many were heavily indebted, so in order to make interest payments and adjust to stricter credit conditions, they needed to maintain or even increase output,93 which they could do by shifting their best rigs and crews to the more productive fields. So all in all, while total spending on drilling sharply fell and the number of drilling rigs collapsed, the actual production of shale oil proved more resilient than expected.94 By the middle of 2015, it was becoming clear that shale oil would not swing, at least not fast enough to remove excess supply and avert another short-term price bust. Exacerbating the problem, Saudi Arabia and Iraq were both ramping up production: Saudi Arabia increased production by 300 kb/d between January and March, and by another 350 kb/d between April and July,95 while Iraq increased production by an astounding 1.1 mb/d between February and September.96 With increased Iraq and Saudi production and with shale producers proving more resilient than expected, global oversupply grew. In July OPEC was producing 33.8 mb/d—nearly 4 mb/d above its 30 mb/d target. Excess oil supplies flowed into bulging inventories. Crude oil prices crashed again, from $60 at the end of June to $42 on August 24. They recovered in autumn to around $50 but resumed falling in November. After OPEC again failed to signal any production cut at its December 7, 2015 meeting, crude oil prices resumed their plunge. On January 20, 2016 Brent crude prices hit a new low: $26.01. Crude had now fallen by $89 (77 percent) from its June 2014 daily peak of $115 and by 66 percent since the November 27, 2014, OPEC meeting.

So on February 15, Saudi Oil Minister Naimi dropped his “let the market set prices” stance since November 2014 and the next day joined with Russia, Qatar, and Venezuela in calling for a collective production “freeze” at levels prevailing in January 2016. Iran refused to go along, vowing to increase its production after just having been freed from sanctions, including on its oil exports. At first, oil analysts reacted with caution and skepticism to the concept of a production “freeze” at January 2016 levels that excluded Iran. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other producers were at or near record high levels in January 2016. Moreover, Iran was expected to increased production by around 500,000 b/d. Analysts knew if producers kept producing at January’s levels while Iran increased production, already record high global oil inventories would keep filling, keeping prices under downward pressure. At best, a production freeze was a very poor cousin to earlier emergency cuts

Around 2008 we exited over seven consecutive decades of public-private production control and entered a third era of market-driven oil prices. The implication is we should expect more frequent, wider oil price gyrations. The boom-bust cycles we saw from 2004 to 2008 and the bust since 2014 (with a boom likely to follow in coming years) is the new normal; the relative stability between 2010 and 2013 may recur from time to time—previous boom-bust eras also saw temporary periods of relatively stable prices before the next boom or bust—but will be an anomaly.

When oil supply and demand are unbalanced and no supply regulator is present, oil prices should range between a floor defined by the cost of production and a ceiling defined by economic pain. In current circumstances, this suggests a likely oscillation in a range well below $30 and above $100. When supply and demand are balanced or imbalances are small, price range may be smaller. But when imbalances are more pronounced, the range will grow.

OPEC as a group almost certainly will not regain control of the market; it would require members to achieve a level of cohesion and discipline it has never shown. OPEC’s role as a cartel, as this book and other research has shown, is vastly overstated.10 There is little evidence OPEC quotas affected members’ production; one researcher found OPEC produced in excess of official quotas 96 percent of the time between 1982 and 2009.11 Exceptions, we have seen, have been the occasional and temporary emergency cuts after price busts.

It only makes sense for a swing supplier to cut when it enjoys market power—the ability to raise and maintain price above levels that would obtain in free market conditions and even then only if the costs were bearable and its post-cut revenues went up. Otherwise, Saudi Arabia will not cut to bolster competitors’ revenues. To have market power, a producer needs to dominate supply and face little competition. Texas held just under half of the U.S. oil reserves from the mid-1930s to 1970s giving it decisive control over the national oil supply.13 Combined, the U.S. and Seven Sisters market power stemmed from control of 89 percent of global reserves, 95 percent of production, and 57 percent of refining.14 The kingdom accounts for 16 percent of proved reserves, 13 percent of production, and only 3 percent of refining capacity (although refining capacity is set to increase).

Riyadh also shows no sign it intends to prevent future price spikes by retaining a sufficient amount of spare capacity. Currently Saudi Arabia claims its maximum production capacity is 12.0 mb/d; with production around 10 mb/d, that implies just 2.0 mb/d of spare capacity. Historically, 5 percent of global production is a generally recognized threshold for adequate spare capacity; in a crude oil market of roughly 91 mb/d, this implies at least 4.6 mb/d.

Since 2011 Aramco (the state-owned oil company) has prioritized investment to expand refining, petrochemical output, petroleum products trading, and natural gas production.22 But in April 2016, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—the kingdom’s top oil official, reformist economic policy czar, defense minister, and potential heir to the throne—said that with more investment the kingdom could produce 15 mb/d and as much as 20 mb/d.23 I interpret this statement to indicate the kingdom may increase production to meet projected demand while competing with arch-rival Iran and other lower-cost Gulf producers for new investment.

Some say shale will spring back quickly. Optimists point in particular to the large amount of “drilled but uncompleted” wells, or DUCs, drilled wells that haven’t yet been fracked to start producing oil. Some estimate DUCs could add several hundred thousand barrels per day of production, with as much as over half a million barrels per day in North Dakota alone.

In my view, although DUCs in theory could certainly help cushion upward price moves, some caution is warranted. First, understanding of the number of DUCs and how much potential production they represent is limited. There are always wells left uncompleted for certain periods of time for various technical or logistical reasons; differentiating between these wells and wells that firms intentionally leave uncompleted in anticipation of higher prices is difficult with available data. Second, DUCs are more akin to inventory that can be released into the market when prices are favorable than a sustained source of production over a period of several or more years. If, for example, two hundred DUCs in a shale basin are gradually brought online once oil surpasses $60, that slight boost in supply will increase for the months the DUC inventory is whittled down and will inexorably decline after the last DUC is cleared.30 Finally, no one can be confident in how DUCs will perform, making production estimates elusive.

Beyond the question of DUCs, shale oil is likely too decentralized and expensive to play the role of market balancer and price stabilizer, even if production could adjust quickly enough. Shale oil production results from thousands of independent firms all responding to their own evaluations of market conditions and the highly varied economics of the acreage they control. As we have seen throughout history, it is nearly impossible to organize many individual producers in collective efforts to restrain production.

And given the variability of shale formations, and the fact that break-even costs in one county can be markedly different from the next county down the road, coordinating supply would be extra difficult.

even if the tariff went into effect, it would insulate the U.S. producers only from low oil prices, not the global oil market. Indeed, a variable import tariff would make global crude oil price instability worse to the extent that it shielded domestic high-cost production from responding to the lower price signal by shutting in.

Energy data reporting should be lawfully compelled, timely, and comprehensive. Upstream, governments should require industry to disclose and validate field-by-field production and reserve data. Doing so would reduce surprises, manic hoarding, and price volatility. Downstream, figures for production, storage, net trade, and refining stocks and flows should be comprehensively reported, enabling much better implied demand estimates. Build Up Strategic Stocks and Coordinate Their Use in Emergencies Given continued tight OPEC spare production capacity and the many geopolitical risks in key oil producing countries and regions, oil importing countries should bolster defenses against price shocks that could be transmitted by severe supply interruptions. They can do so by increasing strategic stocks and coordinating their use with others in cases of disruption. Congress may wish to reconsider selling off strategic stocks and instead bolster them. The psychological benefit of having strategic reserves in a crisis is difficult to measure but should not be overlooked.

Recently, refiners have been able to profit from wider margins while upstream producers have suffered in the glut. (Of course, when crude oil prices next boom, the trend may reverse.) Integrated companies fared better than pure-play producers during the price bust that started in 2014. For an upstream producer, owning a refiner can allow it to offset losses during crude oil price swoons while providing a reliable supply source during booms.

They had to look beyond the individual. They had to understand the culture he or she was a part of, and who their friends and families were, and what town their families came from. They had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.

In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don’t work. People don’t rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It’s not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn’t.

The way Canadians select hockey players is a beautiful example of what the sociologist Robert Merton famously called a “self-fulfilling prophecy” — a situation where “a false definition, in the beginning . . . evokes a new behavior which makes the original false conception come true.” Canadians start with a false definition of who the best nine- and ten-year-old hockey players are. They’re just picking the oldest every year. But the way they treat those “all-stars” ends up making their original false judgment look correct. As Merton puts it: “This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.”

The striking thing about Ericsson’s study is that he and his colleagues couldn’t find any “naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just didn’t have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggestes that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.

The answer becomes obvious if you think about it. In the 1860s and 1870s, the American economy went through perhaps the greatest transformation in its history. This was when the railroads were being built and when Wall Street emerged. It was when industrial manufacturing started in earnest. It was when all the rules by which the traditional economy had functioned were broken and remade. What this list says is that it really matters how old you were when that transformation happened. If you were born in the late 1840s you missed it. You were too young to take advantage of that moment. If you were born in the 1820s you were too old: your mind-set was shaped by the pre–Civil War paradigm. But there was a particular, narrow nine-year window that was just perfect for seeing the potential that the future held. All of the fourteen men and women on the list above had vision and talent.

In 1921, Terman decided to make the study of the gifted his life work. Armed with a large grant from the Commonwealth Foundation, he put together a team of fieldworkers and sent them out into California’s elementary schools. Teachers were asked to nominate the brightest students in their classes. Those children were given an intelligence test. The students who scored in the top 10 percent were then given a second IQ test, and those who scored above 130 on that test were given a third IQ test, and from that set of results Terman selected the best and the brightest. By the time Terman was finished, he had sorted through the records of some 250,000 elementary and high school students, and identified 1,470 children whose IQs averaged over 140 and ranged as high as 200. That group of young geniuses came to be known as the “Termites,” and they were the subjects of what would become one of the most famous psychological studies in history.

Over the years, an enormous amount of research has been done in an attempt to determine how a person’s performance on an IQ test like the Raven’s translates to real-life success. People at the bottom of the scale—with an IQ below 70—are considered mentally disabled. A score of 100 is average; you probably need to be just above that mark to be able to handle college. To get into and succeed in a reasonably competitive graduate program, meanwhile, you probably need an IQ of at least 115. In general, the higher your score, the more education you’ll get, the more money you’re likely to make, and—believe it or not—the longer you’ll live. But there’s a catch. The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn’t seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.

But given what we are learning about intelligence, the idea that schools can be ranked, like runners in a race, makes no sense. Georgetown’s students may not be as smart on an absolute scale as the students of Harvard. But they are all, clearly, smart enough, and future Nobel Prize winners come from schools like Georgetown as well as from schools like Harvard.

What Lempert is saying is that by the only measure that a law school really ought to care about—how well its graduates do in the real world—minority students aren’t less qualified. They’re just as successful as white students. And why? Because even though the academic credentials of minority students at Michigan aren’t as good as those of white students, the quality of students at the law school is high enough that they’re still above the threshold. They are smart enough. Knowledge of a law student’s test scores is of little help if you are faced with a classroom of clever law students.

To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.” It is procedural: it is about knowing how to do something without necessarily knowing why you know it or being able to explain it. It’s practical in nature: that is, it’s not knowledge for its own sake.

Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.” It’s an attempt to actively “foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills.” Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of “accomplishment of natural growth.” They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.

Lareau stresses that one style isn’t morally better than the other. The poorer children were, to her mind, often better behaved, less whiny, more creative in making use of their own time, and had a well-developed sense of independence. But in practical terms, concerted cultivation has enormous advantages. The heavily scheduled middle-class child is exposed to a constantly shifting set of experiences. She learns teamwork and how to cope in highly structured settings. She is taught how to interact comfortably with adults, and to speak up when she needs to. In Lareau’s words, the middle-class children learn a sense of “entitlement.”

That word, of course, has negative connotations these days. But Lareau means it in the best sense of the term: “They acted as though they had a right to pursue their own individual preferences and to actively manage interactions in institutional settings. They appeared comfortable in those settings; they were open to sharing information and asking for attention....It was common practice among middle-class children to shift interactions to suit their preferences.” They knew the rules. “Even in fourth grade, middle-class children appeared to be acting on their own behalf to gain advantages. They made special requests of teachers and doctors to adjust procedures to accommodate their desires.”

If you were not of the right background and religion and social class and you came out of law school in that era, you joined some smaller, second-rate, upstart law firm on a rung below the big names downtown, or you simply went into business for yourself and took “whatever came in the door”—that is, whatever legal work the big downtown firms did not want for themselves.

The old-line Wall Street law firms had a very specific idea about what it was that they did. They were corporate lawyers. They represented the country’s largest and most prestigious companies, and “represented” meant they handled the taxes and the legal work behind the issuing of stocks and bonds and made sure their clients did not run afoul of federal regulators. They did not do litigation; that is, very few of them had a division dedicated to defending and filing lawsuits.

What the old-line firms also did not do was involve themselves in hostile corporate takeovers. It’s hard to imagine today, when corporate raiders and private-equity firms are constantly swallowing up one company after another, but until the 1970s, it was considered scandalous for one company to buy another company without the target agreeing to be bought.

There’s another way to break down the Terman results, though, and that’s by when the Termites were born. If you divide the Termites into two groups, with those born between 1903 and 1911 on one side, and those between 1912 and 1917 on the other, it turns out that the Terman failures are far more likely to have been born in the earlier group. The explanation has to do with two of the great cataclysmic events of the twentieth century: the Great Depression and World War II. If you were born after 1912—say, in 1915—you got out of college after the worst of the Depression was over, and you were drafted at a young enough age that going away to war for three or four years was as much an opportunity as it was a disruption (provided you weren’t killed, of course).

The Termites born before 1911, though, graduated from college at the height of the Depression, when job opportunities were scarce, and they were already in their late thirties when the Second World War hit, meaning that when they were drafted, they had to disrupt careers and families and adult lives that were already well under way. To have been born before 1911 is to have been demographically unlucky. The most devastating events of the twentieth century hit you at exactly the wrong time.

Take a look at the following chart, which shows the birthrates in the United States from 1910 to 1950. In 1915, there are almost three million babies. In 1935, that number drops by almost six hundred thousand, and then, within a decade and a half, the number is back over three million again. To put it in more precise terms, for every thousand Americans, there were 29.5 babies born in 1915; 18.7 babies born in 1935; and 24.1 babies born in 1950. The decade of the 1930s is what is called a “demographic trough.” In response to the economic hardship of the Depression, families simply stopped having children, and as a result, the generation born during that decade was markedly smaller than both the generation that preceded it and the generation that immediately followed it.

The staff is generous with their time, since they have little to do while they ride out the brief period of calm until the next wave hits. When he comes to school age, the magnificent buildings are already there to receive him; the ample staff of teachers welcomes him with open arms. In high school, the basketball team is not as good as it was but there is no problem getting time on the gymnasium floor. The university is a delightful place; lots of room in the classes and residences, no crowding in the cafeteria, and the professors are solicitous. Then he hits the job market.

City College was free, and Michigan—then, as now, one of the top universities in the United States—was $450 a year. “And the thing was, after the first year, you could get a scholarship if your grades were high,” Friedman said. “So it was only the first year I had to pay that, if I did well.” Friedman’s first inclination was to stay in New York. “Well, I went to City College for one day, I didn’t like it. I thought, This is going to be four more years of Bronx Science [the high school he had attended], and came home, packed my bags, and hitchhiked to Ann Arbor.” He went on: I had a couple of hundred dollars in my pocket from the summer. I was working the Catskills to make enough money to pay the four-hundred-fifty-dollar tuition, and I had some left over. Then there was this fancy restaurant in Ann Arbor where I got a job waiting tables. I also worked the night shift at River Rouge, the big Ford plant. That was real money. It wasn’t so hard to get that job. The factories were looking for people. I had another job too, which paid me the best pay I ever had before I became a lawyer, which was working in construction. During the summer, in Ann Arbor, we built the Chrysler proving grounds. I worked there a few summers during law school. Those jobs were really high paying, probably because you worked so much overtime. Think about this story for a moment. The first lesson is that Friedman was willing to work hard, take responsibility for himself, and put himself through school. But the second, perhaps more important lesson is that he happened to come along at a time in America when if you were willing to work hard, you could take responsibility for yourself and put yourself through school. Friedman was, at the time, what we would today call “economically disadvantaged.” He was an inner-city kid from the Bronx, neither of whose parents went to college. But look at how easy it was for him to get a good education. He graduated from his public high school in New York at a time when New York City public schools were the envy of the world. His first option, City College, was free, and his second option, the University of Michigan, cost just $450—and the admissions process was casual enough, apparently, that he could try one school one day and the other the next.

For centuries in Europe, they had been forbidden to own land, so they had clustered in cities and towns, taking up urban trades and professions. Seventy percent of the Eastern European Jews who came through Ellis Island in the thirty years or so before the First World War had some kind of occupational skill. They had owned small groceries or jewelry stores. They had been bookbinders or watchmakers. Overwhelmingly, though, their experience lay in the clothing trade. They were tailors and dressmakers, hat and cap makers, and furriers and tanners.

This was their field. And at the same time as the Borgenichts set up shop inside their tiny apartment, thousands of other Jewish immigrants were doing the same thing, putting their sewing and dressmaking and tailoring skills to use, to the point where by 1900, control of the garment industry had passed almost entirely into the hands of the Eastern European newcomers. As Borgenicht puts it, the Jews “bit deep into the welcoming land and worked like madmen at what they knew.”

“The threshold for getting involved in the business was very low. It’s basically a business built on the sewing machine, and sewing machines don’t cost that much,” says Daniel Soyer, a historian who has written widely on the garment industry. “So you didn’t need a lot of capital. At the turn of the twentieth century, it was probably fifty dollars to buy a machine or two. All you had to do to be a contractor was to have a couple sewing machines, some irons, and a couple of workers. The profit margins were very low but you could make some money.”

The Irish and Italian immigrants who came to New York in the same period didn’t have that advantage. They didn’t have a skill specific to the urban economy. They went to work as day laborers and domestics and construction workers—jobs where you could show up for work every day for thirty years and never learn market research and manufacturing and how to navigate the popular culture and how to negotiate with the Yankees, who ran the world. Or consider the fate of the Mexicans who immigrated to California between 1900 and the end of the 1920s to work in the fields of the big fruit and vegetable growers. They simply exchanged the life of a feudal peasant in Mexico for the life of a feudal peasant in California.

“The conditions in the garment industry were every bit as bad,” Soyer goes on. “But as a garment worker, you were closer to the center of the industry. If you are working in a field in California, you have no clue what’s happening to the produce when it gets on the truck. If you are working in a small garment shop, your wages are low, and your conditions are terrible, and your hours are long, but you can see exactly what the successful people are doing, and you can see how you can set up your own job.”

When Borgenicht came home at night to his children, he may have been tired and poor and overwhelmed, but he was alive. He was his own boss. He was responsible for his own decisions and direction. His work was complex: it engaged his mind and imagination. And in his work, there was a relationship between effort and reward: the longer he and Regina stayed up at night sewing aprons, the more money they made the next day on the streets.

When Louis Borgenicht came home after first seeing that child’s apron, he danced a jig. He hadn’t sold anything yet. He was still penniless and desperate, and he knew that to make something of his idea was going to require years of backbreaking labor. But he was ecstatic, because the prospect of those endless years of hard labor did not seem like a burden to him. Bill Gates had that same feeling when he first sat down at the keyboard at Lakeside. And the Beatles didn’t recoil in horror when they were told they had to play eight hours a night, seven days a week. They jumped at the chance. Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig.

In 1982, a sociology graduate student named Louise Farkas went to visit a number of nursing homes and residential hotels in New York City and Miami Beach. She was looking for people like the Borgenichts, or, more precisely, the children of people like the Borgenichts, who had come to New York in the great wave of Jewish immigration at the turn of the last century. And for each of the people she interviewed, she constructed a family tree showing what a line of parents and children and grandchildren and, in some cases, great-grandchildren did for a living.

It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities, and at this point, after examining the lives of Bill Joy and Bill Gates, pro hockey players and geniuses, and Joe Flom, the Janklows, and the Borgenichts, it shouldn’t be hard to figure out where the perfect lawyer comes from.

This person will have been born in a demographic trough, so as to have had the best of New York’s public schools and the easiest time in the job market. He will be Jewish, of course, and so, locked out of the old-line downtown law firms on account of his “antecedents.” This person’s parents will have done meaningful work in the garment business, passing on to their children autonomy and complexity and the connection between effort and reward. A good school—although it doesn’t have to be a great school—will have been attended. He need not have been the smartest in the class, only smart enough. In fact, we can be even more precise. Just as there is a perfect birth date for a nineteenth-century business tycoon, and a perfect birth date for a software tycoon, there is a perfect birth date for a New York Jewish lawyer as well. It’s 1930, because that would give the lawyer the benefit of a blessedly small generation. It would also make him forty years of age in 1970, when the revolution in the legal world first began, which translates to a healthy fifteen-year Hamburg period in the takeover business while the white-shoe lawyers lingered, oblivious, over their two-martini lunches. If you want to be a great New York lawyer, it is an advantage to be an outsider, and it is an advantage to have parents who did meaningful work, and, better still, it is an advantage to have been born in the early 1930s. But if you have all three advantages—on top of a good dose of ingenuity and drive—then that’s an unstoppable combination. That’s like being a hockey player born on January 1.

Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas, such as Sicily or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain. If you live on some rocky mountainside, the explanation goes, you can’t farm. You probably raise goats or sheep, and the kind of culture that grows up around being a herdsman is very different from the culture that grows up around growing crops. The survival of a farmer depends on the cooperation of others in the community. But a herdsman is off by himself. Farmers also don’t have to worry that their livelihood will be stolen in the night, because crops can’t easily be stolen unless, of course, a thief wants to go to the trouble of harvesting an entire field on his own. But a herdsman does have to worry. He’s under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive: he has to make it clear, through his words and deeds, that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his reputation—and that’s what a “culture of honor” means. It’s a world where a man’s reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth.

So why was Appalachia the way it was? It was because of where the original inhabitants of the region came from. The so-called American backcountry states—from the Pennsylvania border south and west through Virginia and West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina, and the northern end of Alabama and Georgia—were settled overwhelmingly by immigrants from one of the world’s most ferocious cultures of honor. They were “Scotch-Irish”—that is, from the lowlands of Scotland, the northern counties of England, and Ulster in Northern Ireland.

The borderlands—as this region was known—were remote and lawless territories that had been fought over for hundreds of years. The people of the region were steeped in violence. They were herdsmen, scraping out a living on rocky and infertile land. They were clannish, responding to the harshness and turmoil of their environment by forming tight family bonds and placing loyalty to blood above all else. And when they immigrated to North America, they moved into the American interior, to remote, lawless, rocky, and marginally fertile places like Harlan that allowed them to reproduce in the New World the culture of honor they had created in the Old World.

Only in a culture of honor would it have occurred to the irascible gentleman that shooting someone was an appropriate response to a personal insult. And only in a culture of honor would it have occurred to a jury that murder—under those circumstances—was not a crime. I realize that we are often wary of making these kinds of broad generalizations about different cultural groups—and with good reason. This is the form that racial and ethnic stereotypes take. We want to believe that we are not prisoners of our ethnic histories. But the simple truth is that if you want to understand what happened in those small towns in Kentucky in the nineteenth century, you have to go back into the past—and not just one or two generations. You have to go back two or three or four hundred years, to a country on the other side of the ocean, and look closely at what exactly the people in a very specific geographic area of that country did for a living. The “culture of honor” hypothesis says that it matters where you’re from, not just in terms of where you grew up or where your parents grew up, but in terms of where your great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents grew up and even where your great-great-great-grandparents grew up. That is a strange and powerful fact. It’s just the beginning, though, because upon closer examination, cultural legacies turn out to be even stranger and more powerful than that.

The results were unequivocal. There were clear differences in how the young men responded to being called a bad name. For some, the insult changed their behavior. For some it didn’t. The deciding factor in how they reacted wasn’t how emotionally secure they were, or whether they were intellectuals or jocks, or whether they were physically imposing or not. What mattered—and I think you can guess where this is headed—was where they were from. Most of the young men from the northern part of the United States treated the incident with amusement. They laughed it off. Their handshakes were unchanged. Their levels of cortisol actually went down, as if they were unconsciously trying to defuse their own anger. Only a few of them had Steve get violent with Larry. But the southerners? Oh, my. They were angry. Their cortisol and testosterone jumped. Their handshakes got firm. Steve was all over Larry.

“We even played this game of chicken,” Cohen said. “We sent the students back down the hallways, and around the corner comes another confederate. The hallway is blocked, so there’s only room for one of them to pass. The guy we used was six three, two hundred fifty pounds. He used to play college football. He was now working as a bouncer in a college bar. He was walking down the hall in business mode—the way you walk through a bar when you are trying to break up a fight. The question was: how close do they get to the bouncer before they get out of the way? And believe me, they always get out of the way.” For the northerners, there was almost no effect. They got out of the way five or six feet beforehand, whether they had been insulted or not. The southerners, by contrast, were downright deferential in normal circumstances, stepping aside with more than nine feet to go. But if they had just been insulted? Less than two feet. Call a southerner an asshole, and he’s itching for a fight. What Cohen and Nisbett were seeing in that long hall was the culture of honor in action: the southerners were reacting like Wix Howard did when Little Bob Turner accused him of cheating at poker.

Can we learn something about why people succeed and how to make people better at what they do by taking cultural legacies seriously? I think we can.

Korean Air’s planes were crashing so often that when the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)—the US agency responsible for investigating plane crashes within American jurisdiction—did its report on the Guam crash, it was forced to include an addendum listing all the new Korean Air accidents that had happened just since its investigation began: the Korean Air 747 that crash-landed at Kimpo in Seoul, almost a year to the day after Guam; the jetliner that overran a runway at Korea’s Ulsan Airport eight weeks after that; the Korean Air McDonnell Douglas 83 that rammed into an embankment at Pohang Airport the following March; and then, a month after that, the Korean Air passenger jet that crashed in a residential area of Shanghai. Had the NTSB waited just a few more months, it could have added another: the Korean Air cargo plane that crashed just after takeoff from London’s Stansted airport, despite the fact that a warning bell went off in the cockpit no fewer than fourteen times.

One of the pilots does something wrong that by itself is not a problem. Then one of them makes another error on top of that, which combined with the first error still does not amount to catastrophe. But then they make a third error on top of that, and then another and another and another and another, and it is the combination of all those errors that leads to disaster.

These seven errors, furthermore, are rarely problems of knowledge or flying skill. It’s not that the pilot has to negotiate some critical technical maneuver and fails. The kinds of errors that cause plane crashes are invariably errors of teamwork and communication. One pilot knows something important and somehow doesn’t tell the other pilot. One pilot does something wrong, and the other pilot doesn’t catch the error. A tricky situation needs to be resolved through a complex series of steps—and somehow the pilots fail to coordinate and miss one of them.

He had to weigh the risk of damaging his plane against the risk to the woman’s life, and then, once that choice was made, he had to think through the implications of Helsinki versus Moscow for the sick passenger in the back. He had to educate himself, quickly, on the parameters of an airport he had never seen before: could it handle one of the biggest jets in the sky, at sixty tons over its normal landing weight? But most of all, he had to talk—to the passengers, to the doctors, to his copilot, to the second crew he woke up from their nap, to his superiors back home in Dubai, to ATC at Helsinki. It is safe to say that in the forty minutes that passed between the passenger’s stroke and the landing in Helsinki, there were no more than a handful of seconds of silence in the cockpit. What was required of Ratwatte was that he communicate, and communicate not just in the sense of issuing commands but also in the sense of encouraging and cajoling and calming and negotiating and sharing information in the clearest and most transparent manner possible.

The linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu once gave the following hypothetical scenario to a group of captains and first officers and asked them how they would respond: You notice on the weather radar an area of heavy precipitation 25 miles ahead. [The pilot] is maintaining his present course at Mach .73, even though embedded thunderstorms have been reported in your area and you encounter moderate turbulence. You want to ensure that your aircraft will not penetrate this area. Question: what do you say to the pilot? In Fischer’s and Orasanu’s minds, there were at least six ways to try to persuade the pilot to change course and avoid the bad weather, each with a different level of mitigation. 1. Command: “Turn thirty degrees right.” That’s the most direct and explicit way of making a point imaginable. It’s zero mitigation. 2. Crew Obligation Statement: “I think we need to deviate right about now.” Notice the use of “we” and the fact that the request is now much less specific. That’s a little softer. 3. Crew Suggestion: “Let’s go around the weather.” Implicit in that statement is “we’re in this together.” 4. Query: “Which direction would you like to deviate?” That’s even softer than a crew suggestion, because the speaker is conceding that he’s not in charge. 5. Preference: “I think it would be wise to turn left or right.” 6. Hint: “That return at twenty-five miles looks mean.” This is the most mitigated statement of all.

But historically, crashes have been far more likely to happen when the captain is in the “flying seat.” At first that seems to make no sense, since the captain is almost always the pilot with the most experience. But think about the Air Florida crash. If the first officer had been the captain, would he have hinted three times? No, he would have commanded—and the plane wouldn’t have crashed. Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it means the second pilot isn’t going to be afraid to speak up.

way from Belgians. Of all of Hofstede’s Dimensions, though, perhaps the most interesting is what he called the “Power Distance Index” (PDI). Power distance is concerned with attitudes toward hierarchy, specifically with how much a particular culture values and respects authority. To measure it, Hofstede asked questions like “How frequently, in your experience, does the following problem occur: employees being afraid to express disagreement with their managers?” To what extent do the “less powerful members of organizations and institutions accept and expect that power is distributed unequally?” How much are older people respected and feared? Are power holders entitled to special privileges? “In low–power distance index countries,” Hofstede wrote in his classic text Culture’s Consequences: power is something of which power holders are almost ashamed and they will try to underplay. I once heard a Swedish (low PDI) university official state that in order to exercise power he tried not to look powerful. Leaders may enhance their informal status by renouncing formal symbols. In (low PDI) Austria, Prime Minister Bruno Kreisky was known to sometimes take the streetcar to work. In 1974, I actually saw the Dutch (low PDI) prime minister, Joop den Uyl, on vacation with his motor home at a camping site in Portugal. Such behavior of the powerful would be very unlikely in high-PDI Belgium or France.

To Western ears, it seems strange that the flight engineer would bring up this subject just once. Western communication has what linguists call a “transmitter orientation”—that is, it is considered the responsibility of the speaker to communicate ideas clearly and unambiguously. Even in the tragic case of the Air Florida crash, where the first officer never does more than hint about the danger posed by the ice, he still hints four times, phrasing his comments four different ways, in an attempt to make his meaning clear.

He knew that cultural legacies matter—that they are powerful and pervasive and that they persist, long after their original usefulness has passed.

He believed that if the Koreans were honest about where they came from and were willing to confront those aspects of their heritage that did not suit the aviation world, they could change.

Rice paddies are “built,” not “opened up” the way a wheat field is. You don’t just clear the trees, underbrush, and stones and then plow. Rice fields are carved into mountainsides in an elaborate series of terraces, or painstakingly constructed from marshland and river plains. A rice paddy has to be irrigated, so a complex system of dikes has to be built around the field. Channels must be dug from the nearest water source, and gates built into the dikes so the water flow can be adjusted precisely to cover the right amount of the plant.

The paddy itself, meanwhile, has to have a hard clay floor; otherwise the water will simply seep into the ground. But of course, rice seedlings can’t be planted in hard clay, so on top of the clay, there has to be a thick, soft layer of mud. And the claypan, as it’s called, has to be carefully engineered so that it will drain properly and also keep the plants submerged at the optimum level.

Rice has to be fertilized repeatedly, which is another art. Traditionally, farmers used “night soil” (human manure) and a combination of burned compost, river mud, bean cake, and hemp—and they had to be careful, because too much fertilizer, or the right amount applied at the wrong time, could be as bad as too little. When the time came to plant, a Chinese farmer would have hundreds of different varieties of rice from which to choose, each one of which offered a slightly different trade-off, say, between yield and how quickly it grew, or how well it did in times of drought, or how it fared in poor soil.

Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than one-quarter of a second (for instance, 4 is “si” and 7 “qi”). Their English equivalents—“four,” “seven”—are longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The memory gap between English and Chinese apparently is entirely due to this difference in length. In languages as diverse as Welsh, Arabic, Chinese, English and Hebrew, there is a reproducible correlation between the time required to pronounce numbers in a given language and the memory span of its speakers.

But in Japan or China, farmers didn’t have the money to buy equipment—and, in any case, there certainly wasn’t any extra land that could easily be converted into new fields. So rice farmers improved their yields by becoming smarter, by being better managers of their own time, and by making better choices. As the anthropologist Francesca Bray puts it, rice agriculture is “skill oriented”: if you’re willing to weed a bit more diligently, and become more adept at fertilizing, and spend a bit more time monitoring water levels, and do a better job keeping the claypan absolutely level, and make use of every square inch of your rice paddy, you’ll harvest a bigger crop.

What redeemed the life of a rice farmer, however, was the nature of that work. It was a lot like the garment work done by the Jewish immigrants to New York. It was meaningful. First of all, there is a clear relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. The harder you work a rice field, the more it yields. Second, it’s complex work. The rice farmer isn’t simply planting in the spring and harvesting in the fall. He or she effectively runs a small business, juggling a family workforce, hedging uncertainty through seed selection, building and managing a sophisticated irrigation system, and coordinating the complicated process of harvesting the first crop while simultaneously preparing the second crop. And, most of all, it’s autonomous. The peasants of Europe worked essentially as low-paid slaves of an aristocratic landlord, with little control over their own destinies. But China and Japan never developed that kind of oppressive feudal system, because feudalism simply can’t work in a rice economy. Growing rice is too complicated and intricate for a system that requires farmers to be coerced and bullied into going out into the fields each morning.

The historian David Arkush once compared Russian and Chinese peasant proverbs, and the differences are striking. “If God does not bring it, the earth will not give it” is a typical Russian proverb. That’s the kind of fatalism and pessimism typical of a repressive feudal system, where peasants have no reason to believe in the efficacy of their own work. On the other hand, Arkush writes, Chinese proverbs are striking in their belief that “hard work, shrewd planning and self-reliance or cooperation with a small group will in time bring recompense.”

This is not, of course, an unfamiliar observation about Asian culture. Go to any Western college campus and you’ll find that Asian students have a reputation for being in the library long after everyone else has left. Sometimes people of Asian background get offended when their culture is described this way, because they think that the stereotype is being used as a form of disparagement. But a belief in work ought to be a thing of beauty. Virtually every success story we’ve seen in this book so far involves someone or some group working harder than their peers.

Bill Gates was addicted to his computer as a child. So was Bill Joy. The Beatles put in thousands of hours of practice in Hamburg. Joe Flom ground away for years, perfecting the art of takeovers, before he got his chance. Working really hard is what successful people do, and the genius of the culture formed in the rice paddies is that hard work gave those in the fields a way to find meaning in the midst of great uncertainty and poverty.

Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds. Put a bunch of Renees in a classroom, and give them the space and time to explore mathematics for themselves, and you could go a long way. Or imagine a country where Renee’s doggedness is not the exception, but a cultural trait, embedded as deeply as the culture of honor in the Cumberland Plateau. Now that would be a country good at math.

When students sit down to take the TIMSS exam, they also have to fill out a questionnaire. It asks them all kinds of things, such as what their parents’ level of education is, and what their views about math are, and what their friends are like. It’s not a trivial exercise. It’s about 120 questions long. In fact, it is so tedious and demanding that many students leave as many as ten or twenty questions blank. Now, here’s the interesting part. As it turns out, the average number of items answered on that questionnaire varies from country to country. It is possible, in fact, to rank all the participating countries according to how many items their students answer on the questionnaire. Now, what do you think happens if you compare the questionnaire rankings with the math rankings on the TIMSS? They are exactly the same. In other words, countries whose students are willing to concentrate and sit still long enough and focus on answering every single question in an endless questionnaire are the same countries whose students do the best job of solving math problems.

The reformers wanted to make sure that all children went to school and that public school was comprehensive, meaning that all children got enough schooling to learn how to read and write and do basic arithmetic and function as productive citizens. But as the historian Kenneth Gold has pointed out, the early educational reformers were also tremendously concerned that children not get too much schooling. In 1871, for example, the US commissioner of education published a report by Edward Jarvis on the “Relation of Education to Insanity.” Jarvis had studied 1,741 cases of insanity and concluded that “over-study” was responsible for 205 of them. “Education lays the foundation of a large portion of the causes of mental disorder,” Jarvis wrote.

This idea—that effort must be balanced by rest— could not be more different from Asian notions about study and work, of course. But then again, the Asian worldview was shaped by the rice paddy. In the Pearl River Delta, the rice farmer planted two and sometimes three crops a year. The land was fallow only briefly.

These are reading scores for the first five years of elementary school, broken down by socioeconomic class—low, middle, and high. Class 1st Grade   2nd Grade   3rd Grade   4th Grade   5th Grade  Low   329   375   397   433   461   Middle     348   388   425   467   497   High   361   418   460   506   534  Look at the first column. The students start in first grade with meaningful, but not overwhelming, differences in their knowledge and ability. The first graders from the wealthiest homes have a 32-point advantage over the first graders from the poorest homes—and by the way, first graders from poor homes in Baltimore are really poor. Now look at the fifth-grade column. By that point, four years later, the initially modest gap between rich and poor has more than doubled.

The wealthiest kids come back in September and their reading scores have jumped more than 15 points. The poorest kids come back from the holidays and their reading scores have dropped almost 4 points. Poor kids may out-learn rich kids during the school year. But during the summer, they fall far behind.

Historians of science have often noted that at any given time scholars in a particular field tend to share basic assumptions about their subject. Social scientists are no exception; they rely on a view of human nature that provides the background of most discussions of specific behaviors but is rarely questioned. Social scientists in the 1970s broadly accepted two ideas about human nature. First, people are generally rational, and their thinking is normally sound. Second, emotions such as fear, affection, and hatred explain most of the occasions on which people depart from rationality. Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly.

The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails—neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind. In such cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking. This is the slow thinking of the title.

I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.

Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually. When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, as probably happened to you when you encountered the multiplication problem 17 × 24. You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are surprised. System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. In that world, lamps do not jump, cats do not bark, and gorillas do not cross basketball courts.

System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior—the control that keeps you polite when you are angry, and alert when you are driving at night. System 2 is mobilized to increased effort when it detects an error about to be made. Remember a time when you almost blurted out an offensive remark and note how hard you worked to restore control. In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance. The arrangement works well most of the time because System 1 is generally very good at what it does: its models of familiar situations are accurate, its short-term predictions are usually accurate as well, and its initial reactions to challenges are swift and generally appropriate. System 1 has biases, however, systematic errors that it is prone to make in specified circumstances. As we shall see, it sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked, and it has little understanding of logic and statistics. One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. If you are shown a word on the screen in a language you know, you will read it—unless your attention is totally focused elsewhere.

Because System 1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitive thought are often difficult to prevent. Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error. Even when cues to likely errors are available, errors can be prevented only by the enhanced monitoring and effortful activity of System 2. As a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.

Fortunately, cognitive work is not always aversive, and people sometimes expend considerable effort for long periods of time without having to exert willpower. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.” Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to racing motorcycles—and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a book is often an optimal experience. Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly very effortful. In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand.

If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.

Whenever you are conscious, and perhaps even when you are not, multiple computations are going on in your brain, which maintain and update current answers to some key questions: Is anything new going on? Is there a threat? Are things going well? Should my attention be redirected? Is more effort needed for this task? You can think of a cockpit, with a set of dials that indicate the current values of each of these essential variables.

When you are in a state of cognitive ease, you are probably in a good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar. You are also likely to be relatively casual and superficial in your thinking. When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also are less intuitive and less creative than usual.

The psychologist Paul Bloom, writing in The Atlantic in 2005, presented the provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs. He observes that “we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, making it possible for us to envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls.” The two modes of causation that we are set to perceive make it natural for us to accept the two central beliefs of many religions: an immaterial divinity is the ultimate cause of the physical world, and immortal souls temporarily control our bodies while we live and leave them behind as we die. In Bloom’s view, the two concepts of causality were shaped separately by evolutionary forces, building the origins of religion into the structure of System 1.

The halo effect is also an example of suppressed ambiguity: like the word bank, the adjective stubborn is ambiguous and will be interpreted in a way that makes it coherent with the context.

The sequence in which we observe characteristics of a person is often determined by chance. Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the point that subsequent information is mostly wasted.

An essential design feature of the associative machine is that it represents only activated ideas. Information that is not retrieved (even unconsciously) from memory might as well not exist. System 1 excels at constructing the best possible story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not (cannot) allow for information it does not have.

The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely reflect the impressions generated by System 1. Of course, System 2 also is capable of a more systematic and careful approach to evidence, and of following a list of boxes that must be checked before making a decision—think of buying a home, when you deliberately seek information that you don’t have. However, System 1 is expected to influence even the more careful decisions. Its input never ceases. Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI, which stands for what you see is all there is. System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.

is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern. WYSIATI facilitates the achievement of coherence and of the cognitive ease that causes us to accept a statement as true. It explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world.

Overconfidence: As the WYSIATI rule implies, neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing—what we see is all there is. Furthermore, our associative system tends to settle on a coherent pattern of activation and suppresses doubt and ambiguity. Framing effects: Different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions. The statement that “the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90%” is more reassuring than the equivalent statement that “mortality within one month of surgery is 10%.” Similarly, cold cuts described as “90% fat-free” are more attractive than when they are described as “10% fat.” The equivalence of the alternative formulations is transparent, but an individual normally sees only one formulation, and what she sees is all there is. Base-rate neglect: Recall Steve, the meek and tidy soul who is often believed to be a librarian. The personality description is salient and vivid, and although you surely know that there are more male farmers than male librarians, that statistical fact almost certainly did not come to your mind when you first considered the question. What you saw was all there was. Speaking of Jumping to Conclusions “She knows nothing about this person’s management skills. All she is going by is the halo effect from a good presentation.” “Let’s decorrelate errors by obtaining separate judgments on the issue before any discussion. We will get more information from independent assessments.” “They made that big decision on the basis of a good report from one consultant. WYSIATI—what you see is all there is. They did not seem to realize how little information they had.” “They didn’t want more information that might spoil their story. WYSIATI.”

System 2 receives questions or generates them: in either case it directs attention and searches memory to find the answers. System 1 operates differently. It continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind, and continuously generates assessments of various aspects of the situation without specific intention and with little or no effort. These basic assessments play an important role in intuitive judgment, because they are easily substituted for more difficult questions—this is the essential idea of the heuristics and biases approach.

But studies of the brain’s response to winning and losing candidates show that we are biologically predisposed to reject candidates who lack the attributes we value—in this research, losers evoked stronger indications of (negative) emotional response.

The failure of System 1 to compute the total length of a set of lines at a glance may look obvious to you; you never thought you could do it. It is in fact an instance of an important limitation of that system. Because System 1 represents categories by a prototype or a set of typical exemplars, it deals well with averages but poorly with sums. The size of the category, the number of instances it contains, tends to be ignored in judgments of what I will call sum-like variables.

the control over intended computations is far from precise: we often compute much more than we want or need. I call this excess computation the mental shotgun. It is impossible to aim at a single point with a shotgun because it shoots pellets that scatter, and it seems almost equally difficult for System 1 not to do more than System 2 charges it to do.

TensorFlow is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) servers. TensorFlow (TF) was created at Google and supports many of its large-scale Machine Learning applications. It was open sourced in November 2015. Keras is a high-level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and run neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its own implementation of this API, called tf.keras, which provides support for some advanced TensorFlow features (e.g., the ability to efficiently load data).
